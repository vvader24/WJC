          "The hardest decision I made in the past six months was whether to stop talking with my friends or keep spending a lot of time with them. There are 3 of them, I met them this year. In the first semester, we even worked together on projects. But in the end of the first semester and in the second semester, I noticed that sometimes when we talk together, they talk and I listen to them, but when I talk, they don’t give me much time or they don’t listen. Even on projects, they choose to work with each other, while I look for someone else, even though this mostly happened in the second semester. One day, I told one of them about this, and he told me this doesn’t exist and they reconciled me, they tried to listen me to more while talking, but not much. For the projects, the same problem continued. So, I decided not to bring it up again. The only thing that comforts me is that I still talk to them occasionally. Most of them are calm and mature. One of them listens to me, and I feel a bit comfortable with her. She’s the first friend I made, but the others, deep down, aren’t bad either. Maybe we just don’t fully understand each other or get along well. Anyway, everyone does what suits them How can I take care of myself a little? How should I deal with them, should I cut ties, keep a distance, ignore them, or say nothing? Or should everyone just focus on their own path and do what they think is best?",
          "The difficult decision was to throw away shoes. I used to like buying shoes in the live broadcast room, and there were so many shoes at home. After I got married, my husband asked me to clear out all the shoes I don’t wear. There were shoes all under the bed. I didn’t agree before because they were all new shoes that I had never worn and I couldn’t bear to throw them away. I definitely didn’t want to throw them away after spending money to buy them and never wearing them. Later, he said, \"Can you wear so many shoes? They just take up space at home. Go and clear out the shoes, the ones you don’t like and the ones that don’t look good now. Next time you go back to your hometown, bring them back to your relatives. These shoes can be said to be useful, and it’s better than throwing them away.\" So I did it later. I was reluctant to do so when I made this decision, but then I thought about it and realized my husband was right. I didn’t wear them and they took up space at home. The shoes peeled and came undone after being kept for a long time, so I had to throw them away. It was a waste of money and I never wore them. Later, during the Chinese New Year, I brought the cleaned shoes back to my aunts, and they were very happy to wear them.",

The biggest challenge I faced was going along with my family's expectations. They had always dreamed of me becoming a doctor. Explaining that – that I wanted to study business – was very difficult. I was afraid of moving in with them. Another challenge was my insecurities. I was afraid of making the wrong choice and regretting it later. The thought \"What if this had happened?\" was always in the back of my mind. Finally, there was a lot of pressure from my friends. Many of them chose the science stream. Going against that was a very scary experience for me.",

It was winter in [specific year], and I, my parents, and my spouse were in my home. The home carries many memories, and my parents are used to living here and are reluctant to leave. However, in order for our children to receive a better education in a big city and for us to have more opportunities for our own career development, we felt that it was necessary to buy a house in a big city. The family sat together and discussed repeatedly, each with their own concerns, and the atmosphere was very solemn. The specific problems encountered when making this decision are: First, emotional separation. I have lived in my hometown house for many years and have deep feelings for it. I feel reluctant to sell it. Second, economic pressure. House prices in big cities are high. Even if I sell my hometown house, I may still have to bear a high mortgage loan, which will increase my living burden. Third, the problem of parents' adaptation. I am worried that my parents will have difficulty adapting to the new environment in the big city and lose their familiar social circle, which will affect their quality of life.",

On top of that, I don't have a driving license, so the job has to be a good fit for them because otherwise no one will take me to it because \"it's not right for you.\" So I had to look online for specific offers that they considered \"appropriately ambitious.\" In my area, there are few permanent jobs that revolve around my education (which I honestly don't like and think my studies were a waste of time). It would be easier for me to find a job in a local store than in my profession. Unfortunately, working in a store is out of the question because my parents will be \"ashamed\" and are ready to do everything they can to turn me off that idea with their comments and behavior. Therefore, although I really wanted something simple, I had no other choice but to look for something that would suit them, not me.

          "The decision to buy a flat and thus take out a 30-year loan. I made it less than half a year ago. For obvious reasons, it is a very serious decision, it involves a more permanent choice of place of residence, taking on financial burdens, etc. An additional difficulty for me was that I made it at a time when I was taking important exams at the university and preparing to defend my doctorate, and I could not take any leave from work because I had used it earlier to write my doctoral thesis. My parents also participated in the decision-making process, who helped me a lot in financial terms. They also helped me look for a flat. The decision was also influenced by a friend from whom I had previously rented a room, who assured me that although he was planning a general renovation, it would not take place immediately, so I could still be calm about the possibility of continuing to rent the room for some time (although it was known that the renovation would eventually be carried out). The problem was certainly finding the time to make it in a fully thoughtful and unhurried manner. I had numerous concerns related to the fact that I would not check the apartment thoroughly enough or that the formalities related to taking out a loan would be time-consuming and would negatively affect my doctorate, cause me to do badly on exams or defense or fail the deadline. Fortunately, thanks to a good credit advisor and real estate agent, it went smoothly. Despite the fact that I did not try, for example, to talk to the neighbors before buying, it turned out that I had come to the right place. Another problem was that I decided to live in a city other than the one where my university is located, which made it difficult to start scientific work in the future. So I had to decide whether I wanted to work at the university before I even found out how my doctorate would be received and whether it would open the door to professional scientific work. However, I decided that the city where my university is located is even more expensive and far from my hometown, and working in science is associated with low wages, so I have to choose a safer and more reliable life option - working outside of science.",

          "This decision concerned the end of my toxic 2.5-year relationship. It concerned me, my then-boyfriend, his mother and my closest friend. It took place between February and August 2022. My boyfriend abused me extremely mentally, occasionally physically and regularly sexually. My then-boyfriend abruptly broke up with me wanting to switch to \"friendship\". At my request, we simply changed it to \"break\". It turned out that he already had a new partner at that time... It was our mutual friend who I personally introduced him to. Although he was in a relationship with her, he harassed me, sexually provoked me and manipulated me to have sex despite my sexual blockages, which were created by many rapes and molestations in the past. He also committed rape and attempted rape, as well as the aforementioned molestation. During the \"break\" they were giggling and cuddling behind my back... In the meantime I was in the same room in silent tears and with paralysis combined with panic attacks that even Xanax didn't help. Something similar to Stockholm syndrome developed in me. After the rape and another attempt by him, he began to be enslaved. To rationalize his actions. I wanted to talk about what was wrong, but month by month he wanted to cooperate less and even reacted with aggression to attempts at communication. Requests for him to go to a psychologist and a doctor, both mine and his mother's, did not work. What he should have treated, he took out on me. He called me names, humiliated me, made me feel complexed, scared... I was ruined. The relationship dissolved itself, but the decision remained what to do next. Because of the syndrome I was unable to free myself, and despite the relationship he was using me. I tried to set a boundary explaining that he would not let me fall out of love by doing this. He stopped for a moment, but then he repeated it, which was already blatant harassment without remorse. My body did not cooperate despite the willingness to make a decision, my mental state and Stockholm syndrome blocked my options. It was getting worse and worse... I was afraid every day and every day I wanted to die. I no longer saw any sense in anything. It dragged on for months. I felt like a prisoner. Due to the prolonged decisions and helplessness, I had to stop my studies and take a year break for health reasons. I was unable to function normally. They also planned to fire me from my job. They abused me there. My friend Dawid came to help... An idiot who moved to Krakow out of love to save me from myself, when he was later facing rejection, because he was not my type and I did not feel that our personalities were a good match. Despite this, he came, settled here and saved me... not yet knowing that rejection was waiting for him. He did not even tell me! I only found out after the fact and I felt so guilty... My condition made him do something like that in emotion. Without him I can say that I would most likely not be alive. He helped me make the decision to close this chapter and move to survive... Without him this decision would not have come to an end, but my life would. Problems with self-esteem and self-confidence. Problems with a deteriorating psyche. Disturbances in my verdict due to an ex-boyfriend who manipulated and molested me. Helplessness. Financial and educational problems. Conflict in the relationship. Lies and slander.

          "Two years ago, I faced an extremely difficult decision in my life - whether to buy a second-hand house in Nanjing. My wife and I had worked in Nanjing for five years at the time, and the life of renting a house made us gradually desire to have a stable home. My child was about to go to elementary school, and the issue of school district was imminent. Many of my friends around us bought houses and settled down one after another, which made us start to seriously consider the purchase plan. During that time, we rushed around the streets and alleys of Nanjing to look at houses almost every weekend. After my parents learned about our ideas, they also participated in this matter. They rushed from their hometown to accompany us to look at houses, and also took out their savings for many years to support us to pay the down payment. I remember at a family gathering, everyone sat in the living room and discussed the purchase plan fiercely. My father advocated buying in Jiangning District, where the housing prices are relatively low and there is great potential for future development; my mother felt that although the old houses in Gulou District were expensive, the surrounding facilities were mature and it was convenient for children to go to school; my wife preferred Hexi New City, where the environment is good and the transportation is convenient. And I was caught in the middle. In the process of making decisions, specific problems came one after another. The first is economic pressure. The housing prices in Nanjing are not low. Even with the financial support of our parents, we still need to bear high mortgages, which means that we have to live frugally for the next ten years, and the quality of life may be greatly affected. The second is the choice of school district. The price of good school district houses is outrageous, and there is a risk of policy changes. If you buy a house but fail to enter the ideal school, all your efforts will be in vain. In addition, the newness of the house, the structure of the house, the environment of the community, etc. also make it difficult for us to make a decision. I have seen a school district house in Gulou District. Although the location and school are very good, the house is old and the internal facilities are outdated. Renovation is a considerable expense; and the new house in Jiangning District, although the environment and house type are satisfactory, the commuting time is too long and it is not convenient for children to go to school. These problems are like a mess, entangled in my heart, making me unable to make a decision for a long time, and I spend every day in anxiety and entanglement.",

My mother and father supported me in choosing a more \"guaranteed\" profession like engineering, but they also knew my passion for art. I, on the other hand, spent days studying and preparing for exams, as well as spending time in art studios. During this process, I was under great stress due to both the intensity of my classes and the uncertainty about my future. One day, during a meeting with my guidance counselor, she guided me that I needed to find a way to combine my interests and talents. One of the biggest challenges in making this decision was the uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Each path had its own difficulties and advantages, and I couldn’t fully gauge which would suit me better. A second issue was the conflict between my family’s expectations and my own passions: they wanted a “secure” future, while I didn’t want to suppress my desire for artistic expression. Finally, I struggled with a lack of information and guidance— I didn’t have enough insight into the career trajectories of graduates from either field, nor did I clearly understand which kind of university environment would suit me best.",

This happened after years of doubt and depression. With every menstrual cycle, we experienced emotional distance because of this problem The challenges have an emotional dimension because this issue became a daily obstacle. There is also a religious challenge, as we entered a state of fear that we might be going against God’s will. There’s a feeling of doubt that makes you question the steps you can take and consider the reasons, but at the same time, you’re not fully convinced because you don’t have absolute certainty that the procedure will succeed, and if it fails, whether you can accept the outcome. You feel trapped by invisible ropes, torn between what your heart desires and your religious beliefs",

Although I wanted to study, I struggled hard after seeing my parents’ hardship. I thought about it for a long time and finally decided to give up studying. So I told my parents about this decision. In the end, I only finished junior high school and graduated. This also made me a rural woman with only a junior high school diploma. 1. I could not afford the school tuition and had no way to solve the financial difficulties; 2. My parents were very hard-working and had a lot to do. If I went to school, there would be no one to help them and they would have a harder time; 3.

Due to the big differences in living habits, I am considering whether to continue living in the dormitory. Study environment conflicts: The dorm's electricity keeps going off at night, and some roommates are playing games, while others are video chatting. I want to work on my homework in silence, but even earplugs can't block out the noise. Renting a place, while quiet, also worries I'll slack off without supervision, which would lower my efficiency. Financial pressure: Renting is a hefty monthly expense, and my parents believe, \"If you can afford the dorm, don't waste money.\" Renting means I'll have to save on food or find a part-time job, which would interfere with my studies.

          "Honestly, it’s hard to say what the most difficult decision I’ve ever made was, because with time, it no longer feels as difficult. But a tough decision I faced three years ago was whether to go study abroad or not. The financial situation was a bit challenging, and the decision was hard, given that studying in Morocco is tough and raises the question of whether there are opportunities afterward. I’m someone who loves knowledge and learning, but I also love Morocco, and the idea of moving to live in another country was difficult First, there were financial challenges, studying abroad requires a lot of money. Second, there were family challenges, as I was about to get married. Third, and most importantly, I would have had to give up everything I had built in Morocco: I was president of an association that was at the peak of its activity, and I would have had to abandon a small project I had started. There were also many administrative challenges, from the passport and visa to the funds and all the paperwork. Unfortunately, my visa was refused, but it turned out that, in some ways, it was for the best that I didn’t go, because circumstances changed. Alhamdulillah, I now have a good job and my family life is stable",
          "I was being bullied by two people at work. They were constantly picking on me. I'm a quiet person, and I've never argued with anyone in my life. I didn't stand up for myself. This had been going on for months, and at that point, I'd shut up, swallow it down, and when I got home, I'd wish I'd spoken up. On the day of the incident, they were talking about me in my presence, as usual. A customer came in and said, \"I didn't receive a text message.\" They said, \"Nesli definitely did it.\" I focused on the situation, wondering if I'd made a mistake. When I looked at the customer, the other one turned a full 360 degrees and looked at me. \"What are you looking at?\" I asked. \"I'm looking at something wrong with my patient,\" he said. \"Don't look.\" When the customer said, \"Excuse me, I received a text message,\" I said, \"I didn't do anything wrong.\" They said, \"You hear everyone.\" I told them not to talk about me. I got up and was about to go on break, but one of them did. I said, \"How can you talk like that?\" He said, \"Get out of my way.\" I was leaving again when the other girls asked what happened, and she yelled \"Look at the idiot!\" My legs were shaking all the time, and I was so tense. It was the first time I'd ever said anything like that, and they said \"Look at the idiot!\" They were all each other's friends, and I couldn't go back to my desk. I thought, \"I had to do something right then.\" I either had to take my seat again or tell the manager. I quickly walked over to the manager and explained what had happened. I was so nervous, I said. \"Why are you shaking so much?\" the manager said. \"Don't worry, they'll be leaving anyway,\" he said. \"Never mind.\" When I came back from break, the girls said they quit their jobs. I hadn't expected it to be so sudden. Complaining and speaking out was a difficult decision. Everyone thought they were leaving because of me. Their friends treated me badly for months. I was terrified at that moment. I was shaking so much. They said, \"We'll tear you apart.\" I couldn't look at them. I was made to feel guilty even though I was right. After that, they gave me a bad name to everyone who started a job, saying they got me and our friends fired. They tried to cover my name by saying, \"She smells bad.\"",

          "We were to leave the country when the guerrilla took office as president, sell our house and many of our belongings (a difficult process of letting go), and use that money to buy something in Costa Rica. In the meantime, we were to move to a town near Bogotá. The idea was to protect the money and have peace of mind until the guerrilla's term ended. My brother and my niece participated. Going to the nearby town was a good exercise; we were isolated from the politics, noise, and pollution, but because of our age, we began to face health problems that forced us to travel back and forth to Bogotá. Thinking about this, we decided it was best to return to the capital to maintain our health (at least until the guerrillas finish ruining it). It was important to have doctors and medical facilities close at hand. Therefore, the decision to travel to Costa Rica was scrapped. It was difficult to make, but it was the best thing to do. There was sadness, but we must be sensible.",

          "My toughest decision was career-related. I started working as a research assistant at İnönü University. I worked for a year during my master's degree. Because there wasn't a doctoral program, I applied for and was accepted to Gazi University, where I had completed my master's degree. The pandemic hit during the coursework phase, and classes were being followed online. Many people took appointments and went to universities where they earned their doctorates. Even universities that didn't offer appointments were still receiving appointments from the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) until after their doctorates. I chose to stay in Malatya because İnönü University had threatened those who were going to other universities with permanent positions. I decided to stay because I figured I wouldn't get an appointment, they wouldn't give me permanent positions upon my return, and there was a shortage of permanent positions in Ankara. I had a very difficult time making this decision. Ankara offered better opportunities. Malatya, on the other hand, distanced me from the research environment. However, considering my future, I thought I'd easily secure a position where my primary position was. I had professors, family, and friends in Ankara. This situation was very challenging. Now I'm a research assistant with a doctorate degree. I still haven't secured a position. I've always been treated like a secretary, not a researcher. The difference between the two universities has always been a challenge. To make up for this difficult and unfortunate decision, I applied for a research scholarship abroad. Again, I wasn't granted a placement. However, after appealing and seeking legal action, I finally secured a placement. Looking back, I see I should have changed my mind.",

In that job I was doing in the private sector, I got the salary I expected. But since the freedom I was hoping for was in the public service job, I became more interested in that job. I had a great difficulty in deciding what decision I would make. There, I had to decide whether to give up my passion for public service and work in the private sector for a salary, or to give up my passion for private sector work and work in the public sector.

Everything was closed, there were no customers, the goods were standing, and rent had to be paid. There was less and less money, and I didn’t know what to do.

          "The most difficult decision of the past six months has been whether to have a second child. It involved me, my husband, and both sets of parents. I discussed this with my parents at home in May of this year. Having a child after marriage provides a stable life, but it also creates a lot of pressure. Both sets of parents are eager for more, but I'm worried about not having enough energy and my career growth being affected. Financial pressures and the energy allocation for accompanying my first child—a host of practical issues are piling up before me. Choosing between \"meeting family expectations\" and \"maintaining my current rhythm of life\" is incredibly difficult. When making a decision, first, it is difficult to allocate energy. I am worried that if I have a second child, I will not be able to take care of the first child well and will not have the energy to pursue my career. Second, there is financial pressure. Raising another child will greatly increase the cost of education and living, and I am afraid that the quality of life will be reduced. Third, there is a conflict between family expectations and self-planning. I want to take care of both sides, but I don’t know how to balance them.

We were on my farm—where there is no public transportation—and everyone depended on my car. So we decided to head to the capital to accompany the widowed sister through this ordeal. 1. The trip wasn't just a leisure trip; we had things to do on the property. 2. For me, organizing and scheduling a trip with them isn't easy. 3. I don't get along with my sister. 4.

I wasn't sure exactly what my work would look like for my new client, how much time it would cost me, and what impact it would have on our family.

          "I decided to quit my job and focus entirely on my children. This difficult decision was due to the need to find a balance between family and work. Before coming to this decision, I consulted with my family, especially my wife. I also consulted with close people who trusted me. This decision was made on January 25. At that time, there were several weeks of sleepless nights and internal fears. There were worries about the future and, most importantly, financial issues and the health of the child. Financial stability issues, internal insecurity and fear, the risk of losing myself, increased responsibility, public opinion and pressure from others - these are the issues I faced when making this difficult decision. But through those difficulties, I got to know myself better and chose what was truly important: being with my children. I have no regrets about that.",
          "I had to make a decision about the team composition. I am the captain of the darts team, and I had to make a decision about the changes in the team. In the middle of the season during the transfer window I had the chance to swap one player who has been with us from the beginning for someone else who is much better. Very human problems. Because I had to distract myself from any relationship I had with that person in order to make a rational decision.",
          "The hardest decision I’ll have to make is the specialization I choose for the future. This year, I took the entrance exams for the National School of Commerce and Management (ENCG) and the National School of Architecture (ENA). I was accepted to ENCG and placed on the waiting list for ENA. Now, I’ve enrolled in ENCG, but I’m unsure whether to continue with it (which takes five years), or to complete one year and then retake the ENA exam. Alternatively, I might go to China to study architecture or business. So, the tough choice is deciding on my specialization and my academic and career path The challenge is that there are so many choices, and honestly, I want to study everything. I don’t have a problem choosing between business, architecture, medicine, nutrition, or agriculture because I find all of them interesting. On top of that, I’m also unsure whether to study in Morocco, France, or China. That’s where the real difficulty lies, because I really don’t know exactly what to decide.",
          "Deciding to agree to my son's marriage despite my reluctance I was not aware that my son was having an affair with a girl who was not a good fit for our family. By the time I found out about it, the affair had already gone too far. Later, my son asked my permission to marry that girl, and I decided to agree to the marriage because I had no other choice, even though I didn't want to. At that time, the young woman who was in a relationship with her son was about to have a child, and I had to think about it.",
          "Well, it's hard to choose the hardest decision. However, the hardest was probably the one to put our previous dog to sleep. My husband and I shared this terrible and sad moment. It happened about 6 years ago. Our dog Max was 9 years old and had been losing weight for some time. Of course, there were visits to the vet, x-rays, tests, medicines. Unfortunately, it turned out that he had some kind of stomach cancer and there was probably no way to save him. We had to decide whether to keep him alive with medicines and watch him suffer, or decide to put him to sleep. We decided, in consultation with the vet, that this would be the better decision for our beloved pet... Our hearts were breaking, but we didn't want him to continue to suffer and suffer. The decision was made, and with it a lot of tears. To this day, these are not easy memories. The biggest problem was the flood of thoughts and whether we were doing something wrong. We kept hoping that maybe our pet would recover, but the vet left no illusions. It was hard, but we had to make a decision.",

The job offered a very attractive salary, but it required me to relocate from the city where I live. This was in late 2024/early 2025. It wasn't an easy choice because, on the one hand, accepting the new job would provide us with: 1. Financial and social stability 2. It would open up new horizons for me towards other markets 3. I would expand my circle of professional acquaintances 4. I would learn new things. On the other hand: 1. I would lose my freedom 2. Work would be stressful 3. It would be difficult for me to balance work and my family relationship 4. We would give up our company and our dream 5. We would have to move to another city and all the consequences of moving/expenses/instability would follow.",

However, this year my son, who is 17 years old, asked to leave the movement and, after talking to my wife, I decided to stop my volunteer work so that I could closely monitor the situations and decisions that my son is making during this difficult period of adolescence.

          "1. I have been seeing a doctor for my health problems. The disease has lasted for 3 years. I feel dizzy 24 hours a day. Western medicine cannot find the cause. Only Chinese medicine can help. However, Chinese medicine says that once the Yang Qi goes down, it is difficult to replenish it. 2. After nearly 1 year of treatment, there has been some improvement, but the speed is very slow. The doctor said that these methods are very slow.

Since it was just the two of us and her family lived in another city, I had to make a difficult decision because I had to take care of her at that time. So I decided to stop working and end the partnership to take care of her. She passed away in 2017. I believe that this was the most difficult decision of my life, because it still affects my life today. I had to choose between taking care of my wife or my career. Obviously, without work we wouldn't have any income because she was also on sick leave for treatment, but I believe that my decision to drop everything to take care of her was very assertive.",

In March of this year, a neighbor called to say my grandmother had fallen and, while not seriously injured, needed care. It involved me, my parents, and my grandmother. I work in the city, and she lives in a county town thousands of miles away. My parents felt that bringing her would be a distraction from my busy work schedule, so they suggested hiring a nanny. I worried that a nanny wouldn't provide attentive care, but bringing her would also mean renting a larger apartment, adding two hours to my commute, and balancing work schedules with my care. I can’t allocate my time and energy, and I’m worried that it will affect my work progress; the rising cost of renting a house increases the financial burden; my grandma is afraid of causing trouble for me, so she always says “don’t answer”, but in fact she often calls at night to say she misses me.",

I decided not to have an abortion because I believed that abortion was wrong, and I also thought of the possibility of dying in the process. I felt like it was going to be the waste of my life. So, I took it upon myself, no matter what. Whether the man accepts the pregnancy or not, I choose to do what I know is right.

My mother was indirectly involved, and she wanted him to move out (the apartment is legally hers), but we only talked about it together. It was about three months ago. After another argument, I told him to just move out. Although it was said with emotion, it was a well-thought-out decision. It was a difficult decision for me for many reasons; of course, it was mostly a matter of getting used to it; we've been living together for two years now. On the other hand, we drive each other crazy and really shouldn't be living together, but we have two cats together, and unfortunately, they love my ex-boyfriend very much, but I don't want to give them up. Thirdly, there were financial issues. Until recently, I was unemployed and couldn't pay rent, but getting a new job pushed me to make this decision.

We originally lived in Casablanca, but after my daughter was born in 2014, we decided to move to a small, beautiful city so we could spend more time with our baby. We made huge financial sacrifices; my husband gave up 75% of His salary. Our only concern was to spend as much time as possible with our baby. After the move, we bought an apartment and decided to settle down. We enrolled our daughter in the Spanish mission when she turned three. We were very satisfied with the teaching method and pedagogy adopted. I couldn't adapt to the mentality of the people in the city. Living in the city was difficult. I tried to endure it for four and a half years, until we decided to return in May 2019. The biggest difficulty we faced was that we couldn’t find a place for our daughter in the Spanish mission in Casablanca, so we enrolled her in the dual education system. My daughter didn’t speak Arabic and had never heard of French or English. We enrolled her in the first grade of primary school, and she was like a deaf person at a wedding. She cried every day, in the classroom, on the way to school, and when she woke up… and I cried with her crying. She was a very difficult nature. My daughter is now in the sixth grade of primary school and she still remembers this difficult period.",

I worked hard too and by God's grace, things are running smoothly for me and I'm okay. I'm still working. I came to learn carpentry. I came here to work and it didn't pay me well, so I met someone, and he taught me a new job. So that job, the snooker table we do, that's the job he taught me. So that is what I do and it pays well than the carpentry, so that helped me.",

We came home at the begining. We had to go and look for what to eat or else we would be hungry and my father will not give us money. No one was ready to help my brother and I so we had to look for what to eat. My father is a plumber so when my brother finished primary school he also learnt the plumbing trade. He started working and furthered his education. For me, I was interested in the work. So when my brother completed SHS, he enrolled me here. They advised me to learn a job.I got involved but I didn't like it.Getting up early to come to work hurts me the most. When I hadn't started, I could wake up at 6:30 but now it's not like that and it worries me. I dn't stay w`ith my brother and sometimes when you go around to look for him, you won't find him.",

That is my biggest decision I will continue to make In decision, everyone has their goals or what they want to do so the challenges may not be the same, and the main thing I find is that many of them are failure, maybe you decided that next year, this is what I want to do in my life, but by the time you notice you will not be able to reach that goals, if you are not someone that have patience, you will be a failure",
          "The reason for this was that, I was in the village and I look at the situation, that place no one will help you if you dont help yourself, so I decided to come to Accra and work. Although I had a families in Accra but I didn't look at anyone. I decided that no matter I will come here and work. One day I told my mother that i will to go to the big city and work, she also helped me, she gave me some money, i use to carry palmnut and other things so i got small amount of money from it, that is wha i saved and brought it to Accra, by God's grace i got work. God has blessed me without looking at anyone and I was able to stand on my feet. So that was the hardest decision I made in my life. <NA>",

There was no free SHS and my parents didn't have money either. So I learnt a trade. It's a skill no one can take from you. Although school was important and I couldn't go, learning a sill helped me. I'm thought of learning a trade because it can help me in life. Since I wasn't going to school, I decided and spent three years learning a trade. So for those three years, I would have gathered little money to buy my stuffs before I finished the job but I had no money. I wanted to open my shop but I couldn't. So when I finished, I had to work for people and to get paid, but it wasn't good too. I had one child too so it wasn't easy for me. I went through a lot but I had to be strong.",

The reward was good but I wanted a momo sim and started making momo. So now I've stopped teaching and rather doing the momo. I make more money than I already have so it's good. There was pressure in the school but we were walking in it. The momo also has a lot of trouble but we try.",
          "The decision I made was about money. And we have everyone whose goal is to make money and move forward, because life is made of money and it is everything. The decision also outlines the source of income and the source of savings. So I would try to save money regardless of my job or study. I also worked as a mason one day and my goal of making money like this didn't come so the job was completely easy and I did another job so that by the end of the day I would have money to save The problem that people who make decisions often face is that because everyone's home is different some have never had a good home, some have none at all so what it means is that.sometimes when you don't have money you start to be considered helpless. Some can say that you have gone for money rituals. Like this masonry work, you do it the right way and somebody says no do it this way but a little bit of it you save some and you target and you want to get it done",

I am currently working after giving birth because my parents are there to take care of my baby. The finances weren't easy, in the beginning it was, I could go to the clinic and antenals but, taking care of a baby after birth is not very easy, but now that I am working, it is.",

You never get what you are looking for, and you remember what happened to you in the past or a loved one you have left and life is hard. But what you've lost, you can't do anything about so you have to push forward. I had one person in my life aa he was my God on this earth. And he does everything for me. Now he's dead and anytime remember him, I feel sad. If you lose a loved one, you don't have any to replace him. I finished shs and wanted to go to university to study psychology but I had no help. So I came to Accra to work hard so I could find my feet in life.",
          "I actually wanted to go to school because I wanted to see myself in the street but it didn't happen. not that anything was wrong but I was very close to my mother so I started going to the market with her to sell things so I got a fondness for selling because that was what my mother used to help us so I finished school and got involved There are many problems;you have your mindset at the beginning so when the decision changes it is when it pulls you back to what you want to do, you couldn't do it so is like you don't believe in you but it depends on you",

I went through a lot of trouble, because work was not always interesting. Sometimes you would go there with hunger.No matter how bad it is, when I come to work I will get something to do but when I was in school, I didn't have any helper to help me. Maybe your books are destroyed or you need some money to school. I never had any help so my uncle brought me here to work here and gives me money to buy food.",

Sometimes you know you are struggling but there is no helper so you take some of this loan to work and turn things around. I have encountered a lot of problems. the most challenging one is the one affecting the business. When it happens like that then you don't have the money for your lenders, and it borders you if you don't have the money for them. Sometimes, you get to give them a crack and the rest is enough to take to the market for another set of goods. That one is a problem but it's not really an isuue",

I work for a company that rents apartments on a short-term basis. No one from the company cooperated with us, they did not help much with the move, there were many unknowns and problems that we had to solve ourselves from the reception area. In addition, the apartment coordinator responsible for the condition of the rooms was difficult to cooperate with, because she often did not do her job properly, which is why we as the reception had many unpleasant situations with guests. They also cut our salaries. The decision was difficult due to the current situation on the job market, where it is really not easy to find a job. On the one hand, I have to earn money, so I would gladly stay, but the vision of a very difficult job market and the vision of many problems that were to come in the coming weeks due to the move put me in a great state of resignation, because I knew that I would either give it up and be unemployed for an indefinite number of days, weeks, months, or I would have to suffer.",

My company ignored my complaints, and my salary was the same as colleagues who only worked four hours a day at other locations. I could no longer endure the workload and pressure—it was physically draining. I was reluctant to quit because I didn’t want to forfeit my severance pay, and I’m planning to get married in a year, so I didn’t want to change employers. A messy departure would also have hurt my CV, since firms in this sector regularly communicate with one another. Eventually, unable to bear it any longer, I submitted my letter of resignation. I expected a difficult exit, but my company asked to meet with me and—without my knowledge—arranged a covert audit of my center. After witnessing firsthand the hardships I’d endured and voiced so many times, they withdrew my resignation, apologized to me, and transferred me to a different center. Now I’m genuinely enjoying flexible hours and a better salary. The real difficulty was in my own mind, because my company’s indifference meant I knew that, like everyone before me, I would have had to resign and leave on bad terms—and with that reputation, I wouldn’t be able to continue in this industry elsewhere. Had someone at my company not suggested an audit, I’d already be looking for a new field by now. On top of that, we ended up being a beacon of support for colleagues from other firms at that center, and the center was collectively reported.

          "This difficult decision was about my job. Three months ago, my boss suddenly called me into his office and told me I had a business trip to discuss a project. If I succeeded, I'd receive a bonus of tens of thousands of yuan. However, a few weeks later, my child was attending a school ceremony, which coincided with my business trip. My child was going to perform on stage, and he repeatedly urged me to go see him. I promised, fearing that if I broke my promise, my child would lose trust in me and even resent me. I was unsure whether to go. I didn't know how to tell my child, for fear that he would be disappointed if he knew I couldn't go to the ceremony.",
          "A year ago, I was the project leader. A lot of human, material and financial resources were invested in this project. The participating departments included the entire technical team, product design team and colleagues in the marketing department. However, when approaching the final delivery deadline, we found that the core technology of this project had insurmountable defects, which might cause the product to fail to achieve the expected performance and even bring potential safety hazards. If we choose to stick to the project, it might consume more funds and cause other important businesses to stagnate; if we abandon the project, it means that the efforts of the past year will go to waste, and it will also cause a huge blow to the morale of the team. Team morale issues and individual responsibility issues",
          "In the past six months, the most difficult thing I encountered was job transfer. The company's newly developed new business requires me to work in a company outside the city. If I choose to go abroad, I will have to start learning new projects, leave my place of residence, and leave my family, and I will not be able to live with my family every day. But working in another place is beneficial to our careers. The main problem in making a difficult decision is that you cannot balance work and family at the same time.",
          "This difficult decision was about whether I was willing to accept a job far away from home. The internship arranged by the school was in a law firm in Suzhou. After two months of internship, I had become familiar with the employees in the firm. The manager also recognized my abilities and wanted me to stay and work after graduation. However, Suzhou is not very close to home, and my parents are getting older. They hope that I will stay with them, which made it difficult for me to decide. In the end, I chose to stay in my hometown to develop and gave up this good opportunity. If I don't accept this job, I may miss the opportunity to develop in a big city and give up the high salary. It will be difficult for me to find a job that satisfies me in my hometown, so I will have to continue to be raised by my parents at home, and my friends in Suzhou will gradually lose contact.",
          "After graduating from university, I faced a difficult decision: accept a job offer from a stable state-owned enterprise in my hometown, or move to a first-tier city to pursue my dream of working in the internet industry. The decision was primarily made by me, my parents, and a senior who also worked in the internet industry. My family wanted me to stay in my hometown and join a state-owned enterprise, believing it would provide a stable job, a comfortable life, and allow us to take care of each other. My parents felt that first-tier cities were too competitive and stressful, and they didn't want me to move too far away. My senior, on the other hand, gave me a detailed introduction to the internet industry's prospects and encouraged me to venture out to a first-tier city. I was deeply conflicted, torn between my desire for a stable life and my unwavering pursuit of my dreams. 1. Financial pressure: Moving to a first-tier city means facing high living costs. I worry about rent, prices, and other factors. 2. Career development: In my hometown's state-owned enterprises, career paths are relatively fixed, promotions can be slow, and industry prospects are limited. 3. Family and emotional issues: Leaving my hometown means I won't be able to be with my parents as often as I should, and won't be able to provide for them. 4. Social perception: Many of my classmates and friends are facing similar choices, some opting for stability. If I choose to venture into a first-tier city, I might face skepticism and misunderstanding.",
          "In March, the colleague in charge of the core module suddenly took a long-term sick leave. The project was facing the risk of delay and needed to be urgently reorganized. People involved in the project: My (project leader) colleague on sick leave, 3 people in the development team, 2 people in the testing team, and the docking production manager. The original division of labor has been implemented for 2 months. The development team is not familiar with the new module technology, and some people are worried about affecting their personal performance. The testing team believes that entering the development stage in advance will increase the workload, which is inconsistent with the priority of the production manager's needs. Process: Organize the technical documents overnight and split the module into two parts: \"emergency repairs and new function development.\" The group held 3 online meetings to communicate the technical reserves and concerns of the development team members one by one, and promised to coordinate external training resources. Result: The project delay was controlled within 1 week. The team improved its cross-module collaboration capabilities through this adjustment.

In 2021, our company plans to release a social software for young people within six months, and a project team has been set up for this purpose. The participants include the marketing director, my superior, me and several colleagues. During that period, the overall social and economic development was in a downturn, the market conditions were not very good, and the market research at the time was not sufficient. Some people in the company clearly stated that the company’s resources were not enough to support this project. They faced the pressure of project failure and the impact on their future career advancement. At the same time, they also faced a crisis of trust in the team (being accused of spending a lot of time doing ineffective things). We plan to continue with this project. Due to the problem of insufficient human resource allocation, we transferred two core leaders from the company's existing projects. After that, the progress of the entire project was delayed by 3 weeks. The frequent overtime made some people feel resistant and some even proposed to resign; team members began to question the project.",
          "I once faced a very difficult decision, whether to give up the opportunity to study abroad and choose to marry my boyfriend who I have been in love with for many years. It was in the spring of 2018, and the location was in my university dormitory. At that time, I received an admission letter from a well-known foreign university. This has always been my dream to be able to get in touch with cutting-edge knowledge and expand my international perspective. But at the same time, my boyfriend proposed to me. We have been together since college and have a deep relationship. My roommates knew about this and gave me advice. Some said that love is rare and I should seize the happiness in front of me; some said that if I miss the opportunity to study, it will be gone, and I should consider my future. I was entangled in the dormitory every day. On one side was the academic improvement I dreamed of, and on the other side was my lover who had been with me for many years. I thought that if I went to study, a foreign relationship would be full of unknowns and my relationship might be affected; but if I gave up, I was worried that I would regret not pursuing my dream in the future. During that period, I couldn't sleep well all night, and I kept weighing it. It was really tormenting. Emotion: It is difficult to maintain a long-distance relationship, and I feel guilty towards my boyfriend. Academic career: I missed the opportunity to further my studies, and I am confused about my development in China. Family: My parents’ expectations are conflicting, and it is difficult to balance family responsibilities.",

I was working in a fintech company at the time and had ideas about new industry trends, but quitting was too risky. First, there is financial pressure, as there is no stable income in the early stages of starting a business. Second, there is family concern, fearing that failure will affect their lives. Third, there is uncertainty about the market, and there is a fear that the new business will not be accepted.",
          "This difficult decision was about whether to be honest with the senior management and postpone the redo of the company's new product promotion plan due to copyright disputes. ​ The people involved included: \"I\", the project manager of the marketing department, who was responsible for coordinating the entire project; Xiaolin, a team member, who was the key person to discover the copyright dispute; the planners, designers, and copywriters in the team, who participated in the preparation of the plan; Lao Zhang from the technical department, who proposed the difficulties of redoing the plan from the technical and time levels; and the company's senior leaders, the reviewers and decision makers of the plan, and the partners. ​ It happened late at night three months ago in the company's office. At that time, \"I\" led the team to prepare a new product promotion plan for two months, and was about to report it to the company's senior management the next morning. But Xiaolin, a team member, found that among the materials provided by the partner, there was a video idea that was highly similar to the advertisement of a foreign niche brand last year. As soon as the news came out, the team members gathered around, and their expressions changed from shock to anxiety. Lao Zhang from the technical department pointed out that with the current time and manpower, it was too late to redo the plan. \"I\" was caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, there was the temptation to advance the project on time which might affect my promotion. On the other hand, there was the risk of serious consequences such as damage to the company's reputation and project failure. After a difficult balance, I finally decided to speak frankly to my leader and apply for an extension to redo the plan. When deciding whether to be honest with the senior management about the copyright dispute of the new product promotion plan and apply for an extension to redo it, we encountered many specific and difficult problems. ​ Time and manpower pressure: Mr. Zhang from the technical department clearly pointed out that it was impossible to redo the plan with the time and manpower situation at that time. Team members have been working overtime for more than a month and are exhausted physically and mentally. If they start over at this time, not only will they have to complete a lot of work in a very short time, but they will also need to coordinate the personnel of various departments to work intensively again. Manpower allocation and time arrangement are huge challenges. Moreover, there are less than 12 hours left before reporting to the senior management. Even if they work all night, it is difficult to ensure the quality and integrity of the new plan. ​ Personal career development and risk trade-off: Promoting the project on time means that the copyright risks may be covered up. If the plan is successfully passed, this will become a key project for \"me\" to be promoted to supervisor; but once the copyright issue is discovered, \"me\" as a project manager is to blame. Not only will there be no hope of promotion, but I may also face the risk of demotion or even losing my job. On the other hand, actively admitting the problem and being honest with the senior management may be considered a work error, which will affect the leader's trust and evaluation of me, and is also not conducive to career development.​ Team morale and collaboration: Team members have put a lot of effort into this plan, and two months of hard work is facing the situation of being completely overturned, which is a heavy blow to everyone's morale. How to appease the team's emotions, make everyone willing to cooperate to resume work, and avoid conflicts and resistance within the team is also an urgent problem to be solved. Once there is a problem with team collaboration, it will be more difficult to promote the new plan. ​ Company interests and reputation: If the problem is concealed, once the copyright dispute is exposed, the company's reputation accumulated over the years will be destroyed. Not only will this project fail, but it may also affect the subsequent cooperation with partners, as well as the company's image and status in the industry; and actively delaying the redo of the plan will miss the best promotion node, which may lead to a decline in the market share of new products, affect the company's economic benefits, and also damage the company's interests. How to strike a balance between maintaining the company's short-term interests and long-term reputation is a difficult choice.",
          "Last year, I was working at an advertising agency in Shanghai and faced the decision of whether to change jobs. It involved me, my current company's creative director, Ms. Zhang, and my new headhunter, Mr. Chen. My current company was serving established clients, and the projects were repetitive and lacked originality. Ms. Zhang wanted to promote me to project manager. However, the new company Mr. Chen recommended offered cutting-edge branding projects, but the initial salary would be around 20% lower. I was torn between a steady promotion and a breakthrough. First, financially, mortgage and daily expenses will become difficult after the salary cut; second, in terms of personal relationships, Sister Zhang has cultivated me for many years, and I am afraid of hurting our relationship if I refuse; third, in terms of career, the new company is very challenging, and I am afraid that my efforts will not be rewarded, leaving me with nothing on both ends.",

I'm considered an older employee, and the company has hired a few young people who are quick and efficient. I am hesitant between continuing to work and choosing to spend time with my family. On the one hand, I want to make more money to give my family a better life, but on the other hand, I am worried that I will be too busy with work to spend time with them.",
          "The most difficult decision in my life was whether to leave my hometown and go to a first-tier city after graduating from college. It was the summer of [the year I graduated], at home in my hometown, with me, my parents, and a few friends. At the time, I received an offer from a stable company in my hometown, and also received a job opportunity from a promising company in a first-tier city. My parents wanted me to stay in my hometown so that they could always be with me and have a stable life; my friends encouraged me to go to a big city and pursue a broader development space. I was wavering between the familiar stability and the unknown opportunities. When making this decision, the specific problems I encountered were: First, the cost of living. Housing prices and commodity prices in first-tier cities are high, and I was worried that I would not be able to afford it and my quality of life would decline. Second, there was pressure for career development. Big cities are full of talented people and competition is fierce. I was unsure whether I could gain a foothold and achieve career success. Third, emotional concerns. Going to another place means spending less time with my parents and not being able to take care of them in time. I would also gradually become alienated from my good friends, and my heart would be filled with guilt and reluctance.",
          "At the beginning of February this year, just after the Spring Festival holiday, I was urgently recalled by the company. As the deputy manager of the marketing department, I had to decide within a week whether to accept the transfer from the headquarters and take over the South China branch that was on the verge of dissolution. ​ The reason for this was that the performance of the South China branch continued to decline. The company's senior management lost confidence in the head of the branch, Mr. Li, and planned to lay off the entire department. Mr. Li and I have been friends in the workplace for many years and have worked together to start a business. Mr. Li is a righteous man. When I encountered setbacks when I first entered the workplace, he helped me and gave me opportunities many times. Most of the members of the South China team he led were old colleagues who had fought side by side with me. Some of them had just taken out loans to buy houses, and some had young children. Once the department was disbanded, these people would face the crisis of unemployment. But the transfer conditions of the headquarters were indeed attractive. If the South China branch could be revitalized, I would be directly promoted to the general manager of the marketing department, and my salary and career development prospects would be greatly improved. But the reality is not optimistic. The competition in the South China market is extremely fierce, the branch is short of funds, and the team morale is low. It is not easy to reverse the situation. If I still cannot change the current situation after taking over, not only will my professional reputation be damaged, but the situation of Mr. Li and his team members will become even more difficult. During the week of making the decision, CEO Li talked to me many times, expressing his reluctance to leave the team and his concerns about the future. The leaders at the headquarters kept putting pressure on me to give a response as soon as possible. My family also had different opinions. My wife was worried that working in a different place would affect the family, but my parents wanted me to seize this promotion opportunity. I was caught in a double dilemma between friendship and future. Every choice was heavy and suffocating, but I had to make the final decision.",
          "The most difficult decision I made in my life was one month before my grandma passed away. I had to go to work in another city because of a job change. My grandma was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 2017. As a younger generation, I should have been with her in her last moments. However, because of a job promotion, I had to go to work in another city on July 1, 2017. When I heard the news of my grandma's death on the morning of July 14, I regretted my decision. Specific questions: 1. If I stayed and did not go out of town, I could accompany my grandma, but I might have missed the opportunity for promotion. 2. In the end, I chose to go out of town, but I missed the last time I saw my grandma, which is still a regret.",
          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision I have made is whether to accept a job promotion opportunity in a different city. The people involved are myself, my direct supervisor, and my family. It happened two months ago. At that time, my supervisor came to me and told me that the company had an important project in another city and needed me to be responsible for it. The salary would also increase significantly when I was promoted. But this meant that I would have to leave the city where I live now and be away from my family. During that time, I repeatedly weighed the pros and cons. I wanted to seize the good opportunities for career development, but I was also worried about the many problems that would arise from separation from my family. When making this decision, I encountered many specific problems. First of all, in terms of family, my parents are old and need someone to take care of them, and my children are in a critical period of study. I will not be able to accompany them to grow up after I leave. Secondly, in terms of social life, it will be difficult to leave familiar friends and social circles and re-establish social relationships in a new city. Thirdly, there is the problem of adapting to life. The cost of living and climate environment in the new city all need to be adapted to. These factors made me very entangled and difficult to make a decision.",
          "At home, I had a deep discussion with my spouse, considering the potential financial impact, changes in quality of life, and uncertainty about future career development.

I have deep feelings for my current company and colleagues, and leaving means severing those ties. I am also worried that my departure will cause inconvenience or losses to the team.",
          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision I faced was whether to change jobs. This involved my career development. I was working in a stable company with no room for advancement, and received an offer from another company with potential but higher risk. This decision involved myself and my family. When making the decision, the specific problems I encountered were uncertainty about the development prospects of the new company, fear of not being able to adapt to the new environment, and fear of giving up the existing stability would bring financial pressure. 1. Financial pressure: Worrying that I won’t be able to find a new job immediately after resigning, which will lead to a lack of living expenses, such as rent, utilities and other daily expenses. 2. Career risk: Unsure whether the next job will be better than the current one, and there may be a worse working environment or lower salary. 3. Social opinion: The lack of understanding from family and friends, who think it is important to have a stable job, and resigning is a risky behavior, which brings me psychological burden. 4. Self-doubt: Unsure whether I have the ability to succeed in a new field or job, and afraid of making wrong decisions and regretting it.",
          "The locations were my current company office and my home. During that time, I felt my growth potential in my current job was limited, and a completely new industry was offering me opportunities. This decision was difficult because it affected not only my career but also my family life, my financial situation, and my sense of self. The salary in this new field is comparable to my current job, but the benefits and stability may not be as good. This means I need to carefully consider my family's financial affordability and the potential changes in my quality of life.",
          "This difficult decision is about marriage. At the end of last year, I wanted to refuse to get married because my husband’s parents had agreed to the marriage conditions but they went back on their word and refused to fulfill them. However, because my husband treats me very well and has good character, I struggled for many days and even had a quarrel, but finally decided to get married. I encountered the other party's parents being difficult and naughty, and I also encountered my own parents' lack of understanding and support. They felt that they would be embarrassed if I suddenly refused to get married on the wedding date.",
          "Should I stay in Beijing and continue striving, or return home to take care of my parents? The COVID-19 pandemic hit in the spring of 2020, and my company expanded overseas. I was assigned a three-year overseas assignment, with my salary doubled. However, my parents were in poor health and had no one to care for them. Ultimately, between career advancement and family, I chose to forgo overseas development. This resulted in a 20% salary cut over the three years, but fortunately, my parents' health gradually recovered. I have encountered career development opportunities and my parents are in poor health and need care. The meaning of making money is to live a happy life for my family. If I go abroad to develop and my parents are gone, then making money will be meaningless.",
          "I once faced a difficult decision of whether to accept an overseas assignment. It was 2018, and my boss came to talk to me in the company office about this opportunity. The people involved were my boss and I. The assignment was overseas and the project lasted for three years. The specific problems I faced at that time were: First, in terms of family, my child had just started elementary school and my parents were getting older, making it difficult to take care of them while I was away for a long time; second, in terms of career development, although there were opportunities for promotion when I was assigned abroad, I was also worried about the inability to connect with my current position after returning home; third, the problem of adapting to life, I was unsure about going to a country with a different language and culture.",
          "That night I sat at home, staring at the email on my computer screen: \"Congratulations, the project has been approved, and we look forward to your joining.\" The company gave me an opportunity to work as an overseas project manager in San Francisco, with a much higher annual salary and a promotion. But at the same time, I had just found a small shop suitable for opening a coffee shop, and the signing of the lease was stuck in the next one or two days. I was confused. I knew that if I chose to go abroad, I would continue on a stable but boring path; and opening a coffee shop was my dream, but it was full of risks. My girlfriend sat next to me, gently held my hand and said, \"What do you want to do?\" At that moment, I felt unprecedented heaviness - this was not a simple choice, it was a watershed in the direction of my life. The first is financial pressure. If I give up my high-paying job to open a coffee shop, the initial investment is large and the income is unstable, and the quality of life of my girlfriend and I may drop significantly. The second is the uncertainty of future development - if the coffee shop fails, can I return to the original industry? The third is the balance between family and love. My girlfriend supports me in pursuing my dreams, but she also hopes to have a stable life. Finally, there is self-doubt: Do I really have the ability to run a coffee shop? Or is it just a temporary enthusiasm? These questions are intertwined, making each choice seem heavy.",
          "This difficult decision was about work. The people involved at the time included my parents, my cousins and my wife, and myself. It happened in June 2021 in Nanchang. At that time, I had a job I loved, working in a neighborhood committee under the street office. Because the salary was low, my relatives recommended me to work in a private enterprise. I considered this decision for more than a month. 1. The new company is in Shenzhen, and I have to start over in a strange city; 2. I have never worked in a new job before, and I have to learn it again;",
          "Difficult decision: whether to accept the job offer to be assigned to Africa Time: December 2024 Location: Beijing (current residence) and Lagos, Nigeria (assignment location) Involved people: me (28 years old, engineer), girlfriend, project manager, HR Background: I have worked as a structural engineer for a Beijing infrastructure company for three years, responsible for domestic projects. In early December 2024, the company launched a cross-border railway project in Africa and nominated me as the on-site technical leader for a 2-year assignment. I was promised to be promoted to project supervisor and enjoy overseas allowances (double salary + full reimbursement of family air tickets). At the same time, my girlfriend is preparing a startup company in Beijing (in the field of environmental protection technology) and plans to land the first project in the first half of 2025. We were originally scheduled to get engaged in May 2025. Key conflicts and details: The game between career development and emotional stability: The project manager emphasized: \"This is the first time the company has participated in large-scale infrastructure in Africa, and I will directly enter the management after returning home\"; HR reminded that \"colleagues competing for promotion at the same time have priority if they have overseas experience.\" My girlfriend's startup project requires full investment in the early stage. If I am assigned overseas, she will have to deal with financing and team building alone, and a cross-border relationship may increase emotional risks (she has psychological trauma because her ex-boyfriend cheated on her in a different place). Real risks and family pressure: The security situation in Nigeria is complicated (the company requires overseas personnel not to go out after 22:00), and medical resources are limited (malaria and dengue fever are prevalent). After learning about it, my parents called every day to dissuade me, worried that \"I made money but lost my health.\" The assignment contract stipulates that \"you are not allowed to return to the country without authorization during the period, and special circumstances require approval from the headquarters.\" My girlfriend's grandfather is seriously ill, and she is afraid that \"if you are not around when your relatives pass away, we will all regret it.\" Fatal conflict of timeline: The company requires the signing of the assignment agreement within 3 days (passport renewal and vaccination must be handled simultaneously), and my girlfriend's startup project financing negotiations are scheduled in the same week, and she hopes that I will accompany her to attend key meetings (the potential investor is my industry senior). Private calculation: If I give up the overseas assignment, the probability of promotion in the next three years will drop from 70% to 40%; if I choose to be assigned overseas, the engagement date will need to be postponed, and I may miss the key support from my girlfriend in the early stage of entrepreneurship. Struggles in the decision-making process: Using the \"career life cycle model\" to evaluate: 28 years old is the golden period for accumulating technical experience. Overseas projects can be exposed to cross-border collaboration and complex geological processing technologies that are scarce in China, but the emotional relationship may enter a \"high-risk fluctuation period\". \"Hypothesis deduction\" with my girlfriend: If I stay: I can accompany her at any time when she encounters setbacks in her entrepreneurship, but I am worried that she will feel that \"I sacrificed career opportunities for you\" and incur emotional debt in the future. If I am assigned overseas: The monthly video communication budget will increase from 200 yuan to 800 yuan (Africa's network is unstable and requires a dedicated line), but I am afraid that time and distance will dilute trust. I consulted with a senior who had worked in Africa, and he sent me a photo of the construction site at 3 a.m.: \"You can save enough for the down payment in Beijing in 3 years here, but my phone is full of tickets for my girlfriend to watch movies alone.\" Final decision: On the eve of the signing of the agreement, I applied to the company to \"retain the promotion qualification and postpone the overseas assignment until 2026\", on the grounds that \"my fiancée needs to deal with risks together during the critical period of entrepreneurship.\" Core considerations: Compared with my girlfriend's entrepreneurial success rate (about 35% according to industry analysis) and my future overseas assignment opportunities (the company plans to continue to expand its African business within 5 years), the former is more time-effective. My parents suggested that \"I can temporarily borrow 200,000 to support my girlfriend's entrepreneurship\", which alleviated her financial pressure and also convinced me that \"family support can reduce the risk of staying in Beijing.\" Conflict between career advancement and emotional stability: Being assigned abroad can accelerate promotion, but the risk of a foreign relationship is high, and the girlfriend needs support in starting a business. Safety and health risks: The medical conditions in the place of assignment are poor, the public security risk is high, and the parents are very worried. Timeline squeeze: The company requires signing within 3 days, which overlaps with the girlfriend's critical period for entrepreneurship financing. Game between family responsibilities and personal ideals: The girlfriend's relatives are seriously ill and need to accompany her, but the career opportunity may be \"too late\". Uncertainty in the future: Staying in Beijing is afraid of missing out on overseas gilding, and being assigned abroad is afraid of emotional changes or business failure.",

My parents favored the stability of state-owned enterprises, my girlfriend worried about the risks of starting a business, and my childhood friend was eager to join us. Problems include: quitting a stable job, fearing failure and the difficulty of returning; parents threatening to end their relationship; a girlfriend worried that financial instability would affect their marriage; insufficient start-up capital and the need to borrow money; a daily struggle between reality and ideals.",

At the same time, I feel confused and struggling to be alone in a big city. After thinking about it, I finally decided to go to a big city to try my luck.

          "About three years ago, I faced an extremely difficult decision - whether to accept an assignment to work in a foreign branch. At that time, I was working as a middle-level manager at the headquarters of a large company. I had a stable job, a harmonious team atmosphere, and was at the stage of talking about marriage with my girlfriend who I had been in love with for many years. ​ It happened in the summer of that year. The company's senior management suddenly talked to me and said that the Southeast Asian branch was in a critical period of business expansion and urgently needed experienced managers. In view of my past work performance, I was hoped that I could go there to serve as the person in charge. The salary and benefits would be greatly increased, and the promotion space would also be considerable. It was a rare career development opportunity. After the news spread, my family and colleagues all participated in this matter. When my parents learned about it, they firmly opposed it. They felt that I had developed well in China. Going abroad was not only far from home, but they were old and worried that I would not be able to take care of them in time when they were sick. My girlfriend was also very hesitant. She had a stable job and social circle in the local area. She was worried that a foreign relationship would affect our relationship and that our future was full of uncertainty. When I was making the decision, I was in a dilemma. On the one hand, from a career perspective, I was eager to accept the challenge and prove myself on a broader platform, but this meant giving up my current stable life, starting all over again, and facing an unfamiliar culture and work environment; on the other hand, I couldn't let go of my family and girlfriend, didn't want to worry my parents, and was afraid of losing love. During that time, I often suffered from insomnia and couldn't concentrate at work during the day. I kept wavering between the two choices and didn't know how to balance family and career.

          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision I have faced was whether to accept a high-paying job opportunity in another city. This decision involves me, my family, and potential new colleagues and work environment. It happened at the beginning of this year, when I received an offer from a large company in another city. The position and salary they offered were very attractive, but it also meant that I needed to leave the city where I currently live and be separated from my family and friends. Specifically, this decision involves me, because I am the one who is directly affected by this job opportunity; at the same time, it also involves my family, especially my spouse and children, because our family life will undergo major changes; in addition, it also involves my future colleagues and work environment, because this will be a new starting point in my career. The situation at the time was that although my current job was stable, the salary and promotion space were limited. This new job not only offered a higher salary, but also better career development prospects. However, it also meant that I needed to give up my current familiar living environment and start over in a completely new city. Family factors: Spouse's work and social circle: My spouse has a stable job in the current city and has established her own social circle. If she accepts a new job, she may need to give up her current job or face long-distance separation, which will have an impact on her career development and quality of life. Children's education: Our child is in elementary school, and accepting a new job means that he needs to transfer to another city, which may have a certain impact on his learning and social life. We need to consider whether the educational resources in the new city are suitable for the child and whether he can adapt to the new learning environment. Personal career development: Challenges and opportunities of the new job: Although the new job provides better salary and career development prospects, I also need to consider whether I can adapt to the new work environment and requirements. This includes new work content, team culture, management style, etc. Risks of career transition: Accepting a new job may mean that I need to transition from a familiar field to a relatively unfamiliar field, which involves certain career risks. I need to evaluate whether I have sufficient capabilities and resources to cope with this transition. Life adaptation: Living environment in a new city: I need to understand the living environment, climate, culture, etc. of the new city in order to judge whether I can adapt. Housing and transportation: Finding suitable housing and transportation in a new city is also an issue that needs to be considered. I need to evaluate my financial ability and time cost in order to make a reasonable choice. Emotional factors: Nostalgia for hometown and relatives and friends: Leaving the city where I currently live means that I will be separated from my hometown and relatives and friends, which is an emotional challenge for me. I need to consider whether I can bear the loneliness and longing brought about by this separation.",
          "Difficult decision: whether to quit my job as a teacher in my hometown and go to Guangzhou to make a living Time: Spring 2019 Location: A middle school office in Wuzhou, Guangxi, and a job-hunting apartment in Tianhe District, Guangzhou Participants: Me (28 years old at the time, a middle school Chinese teacher), parents, boyfriend (now husband, a long-distance relationship at the time) Detailed background and experience I have been a middle school teacher in my hometown of Wuzhou for 5 years. My job is stable and my parents are proud of me. I have been in love with my boyfriend who works in Guangzhou for 3 years and face the pressure of getting married. At the beginning of 2019, my boyfriend's company planned to form a new team. He hoped that I would quit my job and go to Guangzhou to end the long-distance relationship and prepare for the wedding together. At the same time, the school just promoted me to the deputy leader of the lesson preparation group and promised to let me lead the key class in the next school year - this is the interim result of my years of hard work. During that time, I would be in a daze every day when I was correcting homework in the office, looking at the familiar playground outside the window, thinking of the students shouting \"Hello, teacher\", and my heart was full of reluctance. After hearing the news, my parents rushed to the school overnight. My mother cried and said, \"You have never left Wuzhou since you were a child. You are so far away and you are unfamiliar with the place. What if you suffer a loss?\" My father sighed, \"We asked someone to help you buy a small house in the city. Do you have to live in a rental house?\" My boyfriend repeatedly said on the phone, \"There are many opportunities in Guangzhou. You can take the exam or do self-media. It's better than living in a small city where you can't see the end at a glance.\" I went to Guangzhou alone on the weekend and lived in the urban village apartment rented by my boyfriend. Every day I squeezed into the subway to interview the training institution. Looking at the people rushing around, I felt like an intruder. One evening, I passed by a middle school in Zhujiang New Town and saw students taking evening self-study through the fence. Suddenly I remembered that the third-year junior high school students I taught were preparing for the high school entrance examination. Tears fell all of a sudden - at that moment, I yearned for the possibilities of the big city, but was overwhelmed by a strong sense of separation. Fear of career gap Teacher recruitment in Wuzhou is a \"iron rice bowl\". If I fail the recruitment exam in Guangzhou after resigning, I may face the dilemma of \"30 years old + no stable job\"; the uncertainty of the self-media industry is too great, and I have no experience at all, so I am worried about becoming an \"old unemployed youth\". Example: When interviewing an educational institution, the HR said bluntly: \"You have been in a small city for a long time, and you may not be able to adapt to the fast pace of Guangzhou.\" This sentence made me sleepless all night. Family emotional tearing My parents think that I am rebellious for \"abandoning a stable life to take risks\" and began to ask relatives to introduce local blind dates; my boyfriend thinks I am \"not decisive enough\" and complains that long-distance relationships consume too much of his energy. Both sides are the people I care about the most, but they are in opposition because of my choice. Conflict scene: My mother secretly hid my resignation report. I searched through the bookcases at home but couldn't find it. I was so anxious that I had a big fight with her, and then hid in the room and cried. Confusion of identity In Wuzhou, I am \"Teacher Chen\" respected by students, and parents will greet me at any time when I walk on the street; in Guangzhou, I am just \"Xiao Chen\" whose resumes have been ignored, and I have few interview opportunities. This gap makes me doubt: \"Is it really worth giving up the existing social identity and starting from scratch?\" Economic pressure is concrete In Wuzhou, the monthly salary is 5,000+, and my parents subsidize the rent, so I can save 3,000 per month; in Guangzhou, the monthly rent is 2,500 (single room in a village in the city). There is no income during the interview period, and the savings are reduced like running water. I even calculated: If I can't find a job within 3 months, I must return to my hometown. The game between dignity and reality is played out in my heart every day.",

I was wavering between my dream and stability. When I decided to switch from a state-owned enterprise to the Internet industry, I had a lot of specific problems. First, I was worried that I lacked professional knowledge and experience in the Internet industry and would not be able to handle the new job.

On one hand, I was eager to realize my entrepreneurial dream, and on the other hand, I wanted a stable life, which made me feel torn. When I decided to sell my house and start a business, I first faced strong opposition from my family. Family relationships were strained, and I was worried that I would be homeless and my life would be difficult after the business failed. Secondly, there are uncertainties in entrepreneurial projects.

          "Difficult decision: whether to accept a promotion opportunity in a different place Time: March 2025 Location: Shanghai (current residence) and Shenzhen (location of new position) Involved people: me (working person), spouse, direct supervisor, headhunter Background: I have been a product manager in an Internet company in Shanghai for three years, responsible for the core business line, with a harmonious team atmosphere, and my spouse has a stable job in Shanghai. In early March 2025, a leading company in Shenzhen contacted me through a headhunter and offered me a senior product manager position with a 40% salary increase and access to cutting-edge technology projects. After learning about it, my direct supervisor promised that if I stayed, I could participate in the management position competition for the company's new business line within half a year. Key conflicts and details: Trade-offs at the family level: My spouse's job in Shanghai is in a professional field, and changing cities may cause his or her career development to stagnate. Both parents are in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and Shanghai is closer to home. If I go to Shenzhen, I will have to live in a different place for at least 1-2 years, or persuade my spouse to resign and move with me, but she is uncertain about the job opportunities in the new city and feels anxious. Game of career development: The existing company platform is stable, but business growth has entered a bottleneck period, and there is uncertainty in the competition for management positions (there are other competitors in the team). Although the Shenzhen company is the industry leader, the new position needs to build a team from scratch, which is stressful and there is a risk of probationary period assessment (the contract stipulates a 6-month probationary period, and if the assessment fails, part of the resettlement fee must be compensated). Pull of realistic factors: I have rented a house in Shanghai for 3 years and have a fixed living circle; Shenzhen positions provide housing subsidies, but I need to re-adapt to high housing prices and fast pace. The headhunter emphasized that \"the window of opportunity is only 2 weeks\", and the current leader hopes that I will give my intention to participate in the competition within a week. The timeline conflict between the two sides leads to a sudden increase in decision-making pressure. Struggle in the decision-making process: Using the SWOT analysis method to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two places, it is found that career growth (Shenzhen) and family stability (Shanghai) are difficult to have at the same time. After two weeks of in-depth communication with my spouse every night, she gradually changed from her initial opposition to \"If you decide to go, I can try to work remotely\", but there was still obvious concern in her tone. I consulted with industry seniors, some of whom suggested \"striving for a career while you are young\", and some reminded that \"the hidden cost of long-distance marriage may be underestimated\". Final decision: One day before the deadline, I declined the offer from Shenzhen and chose to stay in Shanghai to participate in the management position competition. The core reason is that I realized that family stability is more important to me at this stage, and the business accumulation of the existing team has not yet been fully transformed into personal competitiveness. Blind job hopping may increase risks. Subsequent impact: My spouse was relieved by my choice, and we began to plan to buy a house in Shanghai. We have entered the final interview stage of the management position competition. At the same time, we continue to pay attention to industry trends. We plan to consider mobility between first-tier cities after accumulating enough experience in 1-2 years. Family and career conflict: Spouse career development risk + possible long-term separation due to separation. Uncertainty of existing opportunities: Competition for management positions in the original company is competitive, and the result is unknown. High risk of new opportunities: Shenzhen positions have strict probationary period assessments, and failure requires compensation for resettlement expenses. Time pressure: The deadlines of the two opportunities conflict, and quick decisions are required. Cost of living and adaptation: The cost of relocating to Shenzhen is high, and adaptation to the new environment is required.",

          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision was whether to leave my current stable job and join a startup. Three months ago, a friend introduced me to a startup with great potential. They offered me an important position with attractive prospects. The people involved were me, my current company leader, my family, and the person in charge of the startup. When communicating with the startup, I was attracted by their innovative ideas and development plans; the current company leader tried to retain me after learning about it; my family was worried that the risks of starting a business were high and would affect their stability. I was having a hard time choosing between stability and opportunity. When making this decision, the specific problems I encountered were: First, income stability. My current job has a stable income, but a startup company may have low salaries in the early stages or even face a situation where it is short of funds and cannot pay wages. Second, there are career development risks. I can be steadily promoted step by step in my current company, but if the startup fails, my career resume may be affected. Third, work intensity. Startups often have a fast pace and heavy tasks, and it may be difficult to balance family and personal life.",

          "The most difficult decision I have ever made in my life was whether to give up a stable but lacking growth job to pursue a challenging but uncertain entrepreneurial opportunity. This decision involved me, my family, and a business partner. It happened about five years ago in the city where I lived at the time. At the time, I was working in a middle management position in a large company. I had a stable job and a good income, but my career development seemed to have hit the ceiling. At the same time, a long-time friend invited me to join his entrepreneurial project, which involved a completely new field with huge market potential but also came with extremely high risks. The main people involved in this decision were: Me: The person who was directly affected by this decision and needed to choose between stability and risk. My family: Especially my spouse, who had an important influence on my career choice because our family's financial situation and quality of life would be directly affected by this decision. Business partner: My friend, who has rich industry experience and entrepreneurial enthusiasm, is the main promoter of this entrepreneurial opportunity. Career stability and risk: The attraction of a stable job: My current job is stable, with a good income, good benefits and career development path. Giving up all this to pursue an uncertain future is a huge challenge for me. Risks and uncertainties of entrepreneurship: Although entrepreneurial projects have huge market potential, they also face multiple risks such as capital shortage, fierce market competition, and technical difficulties. I need to evaluate whether I can bear these risks and am willing to work hard for them. Family economic situation and responsibilities: Family financial burden: I have a family to take care of, including my spouse and children. Giving up a stable job may bring certain pressure to the family's finances. I need to consider how to balance the family's financial needs and my own career pursuits. Responsibility to family: I need to communicate fully with my family so that they understand my decision and share the possible risks. This requires me to have good communication skills and a sense of family responsibility. Personal ability and confidence: Self-assessment: I need to objectively evaluate my abilities, experience and resources to determine whether I have the qualities and conditions required for entrepreneurship. Confidence and determination: Entrepreneurship requires firm confidence and determination, and the ability to remain calm and optimistic in the face of difficulties and challenges. I need to think about whether I have these qualities and am willing to work hard for them. Emotions and values: Attachment to the status quo: I have a certain attachment and dependence on my current work and life. Giving up all of this to pursue an unknown future requires great courage and determination. Pursuit of dreams: At the same time, I also have a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation, and I am eager to achieve greater achievements and value through my own efforts. This pursuit of dreams and attachment to the status quo have created a fierce conflict.",

However, I came across an entrepreneurial opportunity in an emerging industry that I felt had great potential. I discussed this with my family several times, hoping to hear their thoughts.

We discussed this matter repeatedly in the living room, the atmosphere both anticipating and weighing on our shoulders. The first is the issue of economic security.

You are not sure whether the existing savings can support the family's daily expenses and the start-up capital of the business. The second is the issue of career risks.

          "1. Background details of the difficult decision Decision topic: whether to accept a promotion opportunity in a different city, while facing the conflict between family responsibilities and career development. Time: March 2025 (within the past six months). Location: Current home in the city, final decision made in the office after communicating with family. People involved: Me (32 years old, project manager of a technology company) Wife (teacher, stable job, currently living in the city with a regular position) Two-year-old daughter, both parents (wife's parents are local, my parents are out of town, need to help take care of the child) Events: Opportunity: In early March, the company headquarters (located in another provincial capital) proposed to promote me to regional manager, with a salary increase of 40%, but I had to take up the position within three months. This is the first high-level promotion in my career, and the core team resources and industry influence have been significantly improved. Family conflicts: My wife cannot transfer jobs in the short term (local schools require 5 years of service, and we have just completed 3 years). If I work in another place, we will become a \"weekend couple\". My daughter will be taken care of by my wife alone. Both parents are old and cannot stay at home to help for a long time. My daughter has just entered the childcare class and is in the critical period of parent-child attachment. My absence may affect her sense of security. Realistic pressure: The current city where I live has high housing prices, and the monthly mortgage payment accounts for 35% of the family income. The salary after promotion can alleviate the economic pressure, and the educational resources in the headquarters city are better, which is beneficial to the child's future in the long run. Although my wife supports my career development, she is anxious about the pressure of raising children alone, and both parents have also euphemistically expressed their concerns about the \"burden of raising children across generations.\" 1. Conflict of values: family vs. career Career level: promotion opportunities are scarce (only 2 people in the same department were nominated), and if I give up, I may miss the 3-5 year development window; there are top industry mentors in the headquarters team, who can directly affect my future transition to the senior management level. Family level: My wife once gave up an opportunity to transfer to another place for my career development. If I choose to move to another place at this moment, it may lead to a long-term imbalance in the division of labor in the family and even affect the marriage relationship. My daughter only has one chance to grow up, and I feel guilty for being an \"absent father\". 2. Information uncertainty: future risk assessment Career risk: The new position needs to lead the integration of cross-regional teams. There are disputes within the company about the resource investment in this business line. If the performance does not meet the target within 1 year, there may be a risk of transfer or layoffs. Family risk: Long-term separation may lead to alienation between parents and children. If the wife's psychological pressure accumulates, it may cause family conflicts; whether the cost of living in another place (such as rent in the headquarters city) offsets the salary increase needs to be calculated in detail. 3. Emotional and rational game Emotional restraint: Reading picture books with my daughter every night and taking her to the park on weekends are the times I cherish most. I have strong emotional resistance to imagine that I can only participate in these scenes through video in the next six months. Rational trade-off: Make a decision matrix to compare the pros and cons (see the table below), but some factors (such as \"the lack of fatherly love in the child's childhood\") are difficult to quantify, resulting in a deadlock in rational analysis.",

          "The most difficult decision in the past six months was whether to accept a high-paying job in a different city. It involved me, my family, and the new company. In March of this year, I was notified of my job offer after passing the interview. At that time, I had a stable job in my current company, my family was settled in the local area, and my life was peaceful and orderly. Career development: A new job can provide a broader platform and room for promotion, but the connections and experience accumulated in the current company cannot be ignored. If I leave, it means giving up existing resources and adapting to the new environment again. I am not sure whether I can quickly integrate and achieve results. Family factors: My parents are getting older and need me to take care of them; my children are still young, and working in a different place will prevent me from participating in their important moments of growth. But if I refuse the new opportunity, I am worried about the impact on my family's economy and future development. Life adaptation: Living in a different place means renting a new house, getting familiar with the new environment, and establishing a new social circle. In addition, the pace of life and cultural atmosphere in different cities are very different. I am worried that I will not be able to adapt quickly, which will affect my quality of life and work efficiency. Opportunity cost: If I accept the new job, I may lose some potential benefits and long-term development opportunities of the current company; if I refuse, I may miss this career leap. I don’t know when there will be similar opportunities in the future, and I am very entangled.",
          "The most difficult decision in my life was whether to give up my major job after graduating from college and switch to the emerging self-media industry. It was during the college graduation season, and the location was in the school dormitory. The people involved at that time were me and my parents. I received an offer letter from a professional counterpart company, and at the same time, I also developed a strong interest in the self-media industry. My parents wanted me to choose a stable professional counterpart job, but I yearned for the innovation and challenges of the self-media industry. In the dormitory, I repeatedly thought about my future career direction and fell into a dilemma. When making this decision, I encountered the following specific problems: On the one hand, I was worried that it would be difficult to achieve results after giving up years of study in this major and entering a new field of self-media, and I would face tremendous pressure to start from scratch. On the other hand, the self-media industry is developing and changing rapidly, the competition is fierce, and the future is full of uncertainty. It is difficult to predict whether it will succeed. At the same time, it is not easy to convince my parents to support my choice. Their concerns made me feel stressed and it was difficult to choose between career development and family expectations.",

However, he was very confident and thought that there was no problem with his plan. I was faced with a difficult choice, whether to stick to my own direction or compromise and choose the boss's suggestion. After a psychological struggle, I still discussed with my boss and explained the unfeasibility of his suggestion. After a long communication, things finally took a turn for the better. I can study this plan again and give it a chance to revise it. I was worried that my boss would be upset by my objection, which would harm my career. I was also worried that after I told my boss, it would be ineffective and my boss would still insist on his own opinion and not care about my opinion.",

          "I once faced the choice of whether to accept an opportunity for a promotion in another city. This decision would affect the balance between family and career, and would involve myself, my spouse, and one of my children. It happened in Hangzhou, Zhejiang in 2023. At that time, the company proposed to transfer me to be the manager of the Guangzhou branch. At that time, my husband was in the rising stage of his career and the child was in elementary school. The relocation meant that my husband needed to resign and the child needed to transfer to another school. During the discussion, although my husband supported this opportunity, he was worried about the changes and the child would resist leaving. I was caught in the dilemma of career breakthrough and family balance and stability. I encountered time issues as the company only gave me seven days to reply. Then there was the issue of my child's education. I was not familiar with the educational resources in Guangzhou and could not transfer to another school smoothly. I was also worried about emotional conflicts, my spouse's tacit support and my children's fierce opposition, and the prediction of long-term impact. If I refused, I would miss career opportunities.",
          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision was to choose a big project internship opportunity at company A or an internship position that would keep me at company B. The people involved were myself, company A, and the interviewers from company B. It happened in February of this year. At that time, company A was a leading company in the industry. The internship position it offered could participate in the company's core projects, but the internship lasted for six months and there was no guarantee of retention. Company B was a little smaller, but it promised that as long as the internship performance was good, I could be converted to a full-time employee, and the work content was also in line with my major, but the project was relatively less innovative and challenging. When making this difficult decision, I encountered these specific problems. On the one hand, from the perspective of long-term career development, the project experience of Company A can greatly enhance my professional ability and industry vision, but there is no guarantee of retention. After the six-month internship, I have to find a new job and face the risk of unemployment. On the other hand, Company B can provide stable job security and solve the employment problem, but I am worried that my growth will be limited in a relatively conservative working environment. If I want to switch to a better company in the future, my resume may not be competitive enough.",

Actually, my wife supports me to work abroad, but I think it is not worth it to separate from my wife and children for money.

          "This difficult decision was about whether to quit a stable job and start a business. At that time, I had worked in a large company for 3 years, with a good position and salary, but I always had the idea of starting a business in my heart and wanted to do what I like. This decision took place in 2021, and the participants included my parents and boyfriend, several friends with rich entrepreneurial experience, and a mentor in the industry. The locations were mainly at home, coffee shops, and through online meetings to communicate with potential partners. The situation at the time was that the idea of starting a business had been brewing for a long time. I planned to do a project that combines technology and education. Through market research, I found that there was a certain potential. But starting a business means giving up a stable income, social security benefits, and the huge economic pressure that may be faced. My family is very worried about my decision, especially my parents. They think that the risk of starting a business is too high and hope that I will stay in the company and continue to work. 1. Financial pressure. There may be no income in the early stage of starting a business, and you may even need to invest a lot of savings. If you fail, you may face financial difficulties. 2. Family opposition. Although my parents and boyfriend support my dream, they are more worried about practical problems, such as mortgages and living expenses. 3. Psychological pressure. Switching from a stable workplace environment to an uncertain startup requires strong psychological endurance, and I am also worried about whether I can persist. 4. Market competition. There are already mature companies in the industry, and as a newcomer, how to enter the market is also a huge challenge.",

          "Difficult decision: whether to end a long-distance relationship and return to hometown to work Time: March 2025 Location: Shanghai (workplace) and Tianjin (hometown) Involved people: me (27 years old, Internet operation), boyfriend (now fiancé), parents, direct supervisor Background: I have worked in an Internet company in Shanghai for 4 years. In early 2025, I was promoted to operations manager, responsible for key projects; my boyfriend works in the Tianjin system, and we have been in love for 3 years and planned to get married in October 2025. In early March, my boyfriend's unit had an internal transfer opportunity, and he could help me apply for an operations position in a state-owned enterprise in Tianjin (salary reduction of 30%, but stable job). At the same time, my parents mentioned many times that \"the only daughter has been away from home for a long time, and there are great concerns about retirement\", and they hope that I will return home. Key conflicts and details: The collision between career prospects and marital stability: The Shanghai team is preparing for a listing project, and the leader hints that \"staying can get options\"; but the position in Tianjin belongs to a traditional industry, and the digital transformation is slow, and there are concerns about the \"degeneration\" of professional skills. My boyfriend confessed: \"I can accept living apart for another year, but my parents want us to have a baby as soon as possible after marriage, and you are alone in Shanghai with no one to take care of you during pregnancy.\" (He once missed my acute appendicitis surgery due to overtime work, and he felt guilty about it) The realistic pressure of living in two cities: The round-trip high-speed rail fee is 1,200 yuan per month, and we only spend 2 days together on weekends. Both parents require \"living together for at least half a year before marriage\"; if we continue to live apart, we will have to bear the wedding preparations, decoration and other matters alone. The monthly rent in Shanghai is 4,500 yuan (accounting for 20% of the salary). If you live at home in Tianjin, you can save money, but you need to adapt to the change from \"independent living\" to \"living with your parents\" (my mother has mysophobia, and we once had a quarrel over living habits). The sense of pressure of decision-making deadlines: The deadline for state-owned enterprise recruitment is March 15 (a resignation certificate must be submitted), and Internet companies require confirmation of retention intentions before the end of March (otherwise the quota will be given to newcomers). When I was interviewing for a job in Tianjin, the HR asked, \"At your age, if you return to a second-tier city, have you ever considered the bottleneck of your career in the future?\" I cried all the way on the subway. Struggles in the decision-making process: Make a \"pros and cons comparison table\": Staying in Shanghai: Advantages (high salary, fast growth, option potential), Disadvantages (delayed wedding, parents' concerns, difficult childcare after childbirth); Returning to Tianjin: Advantages (stable marriage, low cost of living, close to parents), Disadvantages (salary gap, industry ceiling, zero connections). \"5-year deduction\" with my boyfriend: If I stay in Shanghai: I will need to hire a nanny for childbirth in 2026 (estimated monthly expenses of 8,000 yuan), and I may face \"forced interruption of career growth\"; If I return to Tianjin: I will spend 3 years learning the survival rules of state-owned enterprises, and at the same time try side jobs (such as operating self-media) to make up for the income gap. I called my father late at night, and he said, \"We don't want to tie you down, we're just afraid that when you get old and look back, you'll find that the people you love most are all regrets.\" Final decision: Submit resignation application from Shanghai company on March 12, accept the offer from Tianjin state-owned enterprise. Core considerations: Marital relationship takes precedence over short-term career gains, the \"35-year-old crisis\" in the Internet industry is imminent, and working within the system can provide stability during the child-rearing period. Use \"compromise plan\" to reduce losses: keep renting in Shanghai until the end of 2025 (store personal belongings + occasional business trips), update the public account of operational dry goods every week after joining Tianjin, and maintain industry sensitivity Conflicts in career development: Shanghai has options and promotion opportunities, while Tianjin's industry development is limited and salaries are reduced by 30%. Marriage and family pressure: Being in a different place affects marriage plans and childbearing arrangements, and parents hope that their children will be close to them for retirement. Economic considerations: Shanghai has high rents and round-trip fares. Although Tianjin saves money, its salary is reduced, and it is necessary to re-adapt to the lifestyle. Time is tight: The recruitment of state-owned enterprises and the confirmation of the intention to stay in Shanghai companies overlap, so a quick decision is needed. Future uncertainty: Staying in Shanghai faces conflicts between childbirth and career, and returning to Tianjin is worried about the elimination of personal connections and the early arrival of career bottlenecks.",
          "This decision mainly involved me and my lover. It was during the college graduation season and the location was on the college campus. At that time, we were facing the situation of being separated after graduation. I received a good job opportunity in my hometown, while my lover decided to stay in the city where the university was located. When making this decision, I encountered many problems. On the one hand, I couldn't bear to give up this relationship, as we had many good memories during college; on the other hand, the uncertainty of long-distance relationships made me worried. I was afraid that long-term separation would make the relationship fade, and I was facing huge changes in work and life. My parents also advised me to consider realistic factors and choose to work steadily in my hometown, but I didn't want to give up this relationship easily.",
          "The difficult decision was about buying a tablet. At that time, the demand for a tablet was not that strong, and it was not a necessity. It was a difficult decision for me to buy a tablet because I didn’t have that much money. I felt that spending money on this non-necessity was a stretch for my financial resources at the time. But I also felt that I could use the tablet to do some learning work, which I could actually do on a computer, but I also wanted to study in bed, so I had a strong desire to buy it. In the end, I couldn’t resist the temptation and bought it. The main problem is to choose a tablet with high cost performance. How to choose, based on what parameters to choose, based on my budget, and whether it will be really useful after buying it. After searching on Xiaohongshu, I finally chose a suitable tablet with high cost performance. I can also pay in installments on Douyin. Anyway, it took me about a week to choose the right tablet.",
          "This difficult decision was about whether to accept a job promotion opportunity in another city. It was in June last year, and the location was in my living room. The people involved were me, my parents, and my partner. I have been working hard in a local company, and I have the opportunity to be promoted to a foreign headquarters, which will greatly increase my salary and career development space. But if I go to another city, it means being separated from my parents and partner. My parents are old and need someone to take care of them, and my partner and I have a good relationship and don’t want to live in different places. We sat in the living room and had a long discussion. My parents expressed their support for me to pursue my career and that they can take care of themselves. Although my partner understood that this was a rare opportunity, he also expressed his reluctance and worried that living in a different place would affect our relationship. I was very entangled and didn’t know how to choose. Family and emotional aspects: Worry about not being with parents for a long time and not being able to fulfill filial piety in time. If parents have physical problems, they will not be able to take care of them in time. Being in different places with your partner may affect your relationship due to distance and inconvenience in communication, and the future direction of the relationship is full of uncertainty. - Life adaptation: The climate, diet, and pace of life in the city you are going to are different from those in your local area. You are worried that you will find it difficult to adapt to the new environment and your quality of life will decline. - Career development risks: Although there are opportunities for promotion, you need to re-establish personal connections in the new environment, adapt to the new work team and corporate culture, and you are not sure whether you can carry out your work smoothly. If things don’t go well, you may also lose your existing local work foundation.",
          "This difficult decision is about resigning or starting a side business. It involves myself and indirectly the company I work for. At the beginning of this year, our company's financial situation was very bad. We didn't pay wages for several consecutive months. At this time, I actually felt a sense of crisis in my heart, and even prepared for the company to go bankrupt. How would I cope with the risk at that time? So, I wanted to resign again, but I didn't have the preparation and courage. So, I first looked for a part-time job on boss, explored the market, and started a side business. The specific problem is that I am not young anymore and it will be difficult to find a job. If I start my own business, the cost of investigation and trial is not small. At my age, I cannot make any mistakes in such a decision, otherwise it will affect my family. So I am very cautious, but at the same time I tell myself to face it and not do nothing.",
          "Regarding the matter of asking for money after finishing the work. Before May Day this year, I helped the leader do some private work locally. At that time, I had no plan to do housework for the leader's family, but the leader came to me directly. Because I had talked to other colleagues before and found that I could do housework well, I originally refused, but the leader said that his daughter was going to get engaged, which made others worried (I guess no one was willing to do it during this off-season). I couldn't do it once and couldn't refuse, so I had to bite the bullet and accepted it. I can ask for money, but recently the performance evaluation is much more than the salary for work; I don’t ask, after all, it’s not done by me alone, so I don’t care about it personally, but I have paid every penny to my partners. If I don’t ask, I’m afraid that the boss will forget it, and if I say it, I’m afraid that it will affect my performance salary.",
          "This difficult decision is about whether to quit my current stable job and start a business. It happened three months ago in my office. The people involved are myself, my direct supervisor and my entrepreneurial partner. At that time, I had worked in this company for many years, with a stable job and good benefits. But I have always had the dream of starting a business. Recently, my entrepreneurial partner found me and brought me a very promising project cooperation opportunity. I revealed my idea to my direct supervisor, who tried his best to retain me, analyzed the risks of starting a business, and hoped that I would stay in the company to continue to develop. The entrepreneurial partner painted a beautiful blueprint after the success of the business and urged me to make a decision as soon as possible. I was very entangled in my heart. On the one hand, I was reluctant to give up the current stability, and on the other hand, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to start a business. Economic risks: Starting a business requires a lot of capital investment in the early stages. Quitting your job means losing your stable income, which may lead to financial pressure and even affect your family life. In addition, the probability of failure is high. If you fail, you may lose all your money. - Uncertainty in career development: You have accumulated a certain amount of work experience and connections in your original company, and your career development has a certain direction. Whether your business will succeed or not is unknown. If you fail and return to the workplace, you may miss the career rise period, and there are also challenges in re-adapting to the work environment. - Psychological pressure: The entrepreneurial process is full of uncertainty, and you will face various difficulties and challenges, such as market competition, team management, etc., which will put you under tremendous psychological pressure. At the same time, you are also worried about disappointing the trust and expectations of your entrepreneurial partners.",
          "The most difficult decision was closing our brick-and-mortar clothing store, which I had run for many years, during the 2020 pandemic. It involved me, my three employees, and my family. The pandemic had already broken out, and strict epidemic prevention and control measures were in place everywhere. The store couldn't operate normally, yet we had to pay the monthly rent and basic employee salaries on time. Furthermore, we had unsold inventory, making cash flow very difficult. First, there was the issue of funding. I had originally thought the pandemic would soon be over and I could hold on, but cash flow problems gradually became apparent, resulting in a backlog of inventory and unsold goods. Second, there was the issue of employee placement. I had been with them for a long time and had deep relationships with them. I couldn't bear to lay them off, but I couldn't continue to pay their salaries. Third, there was the issue of future life plans. I was confused about my future path.",

I had just finished teaching for the academic year when I received an offer from an internet company. What happened: After three years as a teacher in my hometown, my job was stable but lacked challenge. I stumbled upon a job posting for a company in a first-tier city, submitted my resume, and successfully interviewed. My parents, believing that a \"iron rice bowl\" job was more reliable, repeatedly tried to dissuade me from doing so. My boyfriend, believing that young people should be more adventurous, promised to support me in adapting to new environments. I was torn between being reluctant to leave my familiar life and yearning for a career breakthrough. I know that I am gradually losing enthusiasm for repetitive teaching work and am eager to explore new areas; on the other hand, I am afraid of \"lack of ability after leaving my comfort zone\" and worry about disappointing myself and others' expectations.",

In the living room, under dim lights, after I expressed my idea, my family members were worried. They were worried about my life in a strange city and the risks of starting a business. I was eager for new opportunities, but I was also afraid of the unknown. When making a decision, the first is the economic issue. Starting a business requires a large initial investment, and the income is unstable, so there is a worry about the capital chain being broken. The second is the emotional issue. Going to another place means being away from family and friends, and it is difficult to take care of family affection. The third is the experience issue. Although you have some understanding of the new field, you lack practical experience, and you are afraid of failure due to wrong decision-making.",

I am worried about whether I can find a suitable job in the south and whether the job is stable. I am concerned about my parents and relatives at home.

The new opportunity was a project manager position at a Shanghai tech company. The salary increased by 40%, but I would have to leave my family and move in independently.

At that time, we were in a cafe and talked about the current industry trends and our own development bottlenecks. We all felt that although our current jobs were stable, our growth was limited. My friends suggested that we start an online education project together. There was market potential but it was full of uncertainty. I was faced with the choice between stable income and unknown entrepreneurial risks. First, the economic pressure is great. If I quit my job, I will lose my stable income. I have to invest a lot of money in the early stage of starting a business. Secondly, I lack experience. Although I work in the industry, I am not good at many aspects such as entrepreneurial design and operation and marketing. Finally, I have a heavy burden in my heart. I am worried that the failure of the business will not only lose money, but also waste time and betray the trust of friends.",
          "In May of this year, I faced the decision of whether to resign from my stable position at a state-owned enterprise and transition to an emerging AI startup. The conversation involved me, my parents (who were concerned about the instability of the new industry), and the startup's CEO (who had repeatedly approached me). The meetings took place primarily at home and in the startup's meeting room. While the state-owned enterprise position was stable, advancement was slow and the work was repetitive. The startup, on the other hand, promised me product operations, giving me access to cutting-edge technology. However, the company was only a year old, its financing situation was uncertain, and the future presented significant risks. Specific issues include: ① Economic risks: After resigning, the stable income and benefits of state-owned enterprises disappear, and although the salaries of start-up companies are high, they may be delayed due to operational problems; ② Family opposition: Parents believe that the \"iron rice bowl\" is more reliable and have persuaded them many times, making it difficult to disobey emotionally; ③ Career certainty: Insufficient knowledge reserves in the new industry, and concerns about being unable to adapt to the fast pace. If the start-up company fails, there will be a gap when returning to the traditional industry.",

My girlfriend had a stable job locally, and my parents wanted me to stay close by. When making a decision, I faced the conflict between love and career (my girlfriend was not willing to give up her job to move with me), concerns about family (my parents were in poor health and needed someone to take care of them), and worries about the unknown environment (lack of connections in the new city, higher cost of living).

At that time, I was repeatedly anxious at home and tortured by troubles every day. A month after I had this idea, I chose to confide this matter to a good friend of mine. His opinion on this matter suggested that I make a choice after considering issues such as quitting my job, the blank period, future goals, and life and family adjustments.

The position offered better career development, but required moving to Europe, which involved my partner's resignation and my parents' concerns. After weighing family, career, and stability, I ultimately rejected the offer because it would be difficult for my family to adapt and there was still room for growth in China.

The location was the city where I currently live. I had been working for three years and felt very confused. I had the idea of starting a business and some resources for starting a business. However, my family was opposed to it and worried that I would lose all my money. Friends and colleagues had different opinions. In the end, I decided to quit my job and start a business. Economically, starting a business requires capital, and without a stable income, one is afraid of not having enough money and going into debt. Psychologically, because the failure rate of starting a business is high, one is afraid of losing one’s job and having nothing, which is very stressful.",

It was not until someone pushed the plan to be revised that our opinions gradually converged. When we finally made the decision, we discussed it in the small pavilion next to the company. At that time, I still felt that my poster style would be better than the one they discussed, but it was still different from their ideas. After comprehensive discussion, we decided to add some of my poster style to the new plan. We had a disagreement during the discussion and almost had a quarrel with the team. In the process of modifying the poster, many hardware elements were missing. However, due to the tight time and the team’s lack of production experience, many hardware elements had to be purchased, which increased our design costs.",
          "About personal career development. The people involved include my leaders, family and myself. The company I am currently working for was formerly a division of the parent company. Last September, the entire division became independent and established a subsidiary. At the end of last year, my leader asked me if I was willing to go to a coastal city to follow up on multiple projects there (equivalent to being stationed in a coastal city project department for a long time in the future, which may be several years or even more). If I accept, it is foreseeable that the salary level will be significantly improved, and there will be more opportunities for promotion in the future. However, after comprehensively considering my own and family situations, I chose to reject this opportunity. The first question is the location of work. I am currently at the company's headquarters, and my home is in the same city. I live with my family. In this case, my daily expenses are low (no rent, my family cooks), and the cost of living is very low compared to coastal cities, while I can also take care of my family. The second question is the issue of personal future development. Although the coastal projects will bring me a significant salary increase compared to now, in the long run, I still prefer to develop locally. Although the salary will be lower, it is more stable. The third question is that there are doubts and concerns about the new project, because the project there is a newly established project, and it is foreseeable that there are many problems that need to be solved. If it is not done well or there are mistakes, it can be said that it will be more than the gain. Combining these issues, although I also have the idea of high salary and promotion, after considering these practical problems and uncertainties, I still chose to refuse.",

If I left the company, it might affect the team and even future professional relationships. After weighing the pros and cons, I finally gave up the opportunity. When deciding whether to switch to a startup, I was most concerned about how to pay for my family’s mortgage and children’s expenses after my salary dropped by 30%.

Everyone pushed me and I didn't want to go. I discussed it with my family, but they also disagreed, thinking that this was not a wise choice. After a long ideological struggle, I thought that what my family and colleagues considered needed to be considered, and I would find a good person for myself. At the same time, I hoped to seize this opportunity, which was a good opportunity for me to grow and learn. Finally, after several struggles, I chose to go. I encountered safety issues when going to Thailand. Secondly, there was the language problem. Thirdly, there were cultural differences in managing foreign personnel.",

Our department had a new project team to be formed, and the leader talked to me and said that he wanted to transfer me there. The people involved were mainly me, the department leader, and the person in charge of the new project. At that time, the department leader told me that the new project team was the focus of the company and had a good development prospect, but the work intensity would be much greater than it is now, and it would require frequent business trips. The person in charge of the new project team also described his future plans to me, saying that if he did well, there would be more opportunities for promotion. But I am already very familiar with the work at hand, and I have accumulated certain resources. Moreover, my child is still very young, and if I travel frequently, I really can't take care of my family. I was particularly entangled at the time. On the one hand, I didn't want to miss this opportunity that might help my career advance, and on the other hand, I was worried that I couldn't take care of my family. First, there is the dilemma of career development. If I stay in my current position, the work is easy but the promotion space is limited. If I go to a new project team, there are challenges and opportunities, but if I don’t make achievements, it may affect my current job. Secondly, there is the issue of balancing family and work. If I am often on business trips, there will be no one to take care of the elderly and children at home, and my wife is also very busy at work. I can’t rest assured that I will put all the burden of the family on her. Moreover, the new position requires exposure to new business and requires relearning a lot of things. If I don’t learn well, I will be passive at work. By then, I will not be able to take care of both my career and family, which will be very troublesome.",
          "In March of this year, I was forced to resign from the company's HR department due to company layoffs, and I was struggling with whether to accept a new low-paying job or start my own business. I was unwilling to accept a low-paying job, and I didn’t have enough money to start a business. Finally, I decided to take training and accept a new job.",
          "The most difficult decision I have made in the past six months was whether to accept an overseas job opportunity. This decision involved me, my family, and a potential new employer. It happened at the beginning of this year. Through a former colleague, I learned about a job vacancy in an overseas branch of an international company. This position was highly consistent with my career plan and provided a broader development space and more competitive salary. Specifically, this decision began to be seriously considered on a weekend in February this year. At that time, I received a detailed job description and interview invitation from the new employer. In the following weeks, I went through multiple rounds of interviews and had in-depth exchanges with team members and superiors. At the same time, I also began to discuss this opportunity with my family, including possible life changes, children's education issues, and adjustments to family relationships. Family factors: Spouse's work and adaptation: My spouse currently has a stable job in China and is very satisfied with the current living environment. If she accepts overseas work, she may need to give up her current job and find career opportunities in a completely new environment, which is a huge challenge for her. Children's education: Our child is in elementary school, and transferring to an unfamiliar education system may have an impact on his learning and growth. We need to consider how to ensure that he can adapt smoothly to the new environment and continue to maintain a good learning state. Maintaining family relationships: Leaving China means that we will be separated from our relatives and friends, which may have a certain impact on family relationships. We need to consider how to keep in touch with our family and how to support them at important moments. Career development: Uncertainty in career prospects: Although overseas work provides a broader development space, I am also worried about whether I can adapt to the new work environment and cultural background, and whether I can play my strengths in the new team. Career positioning after returning to China: If I accept overseas work, I may face the problem of career positioning when I return to China a few years later. I need to consider how to reposition myself in the domestic market and how to use overseas work experience to increase competitiveness in my career development. Life adaptation: Cultural differences: Working overseas means that I will live in a country with a completely different cultural background, which may bring a series of life adaptation problems, including language barriers, eating habits, social habits, etc. Safety and health: I also need to consider the safety and medical conditions of the destination to ensure that my life and my family's life overseas can be fully protected.",
          "I chose to work part-time. There were not many people involved, only me, the agency and the employer. It happened in my city. In March of this year, I chose to earn a living through part-time work. Before that, I hesitated for a long time, considering a series of issues such as safety and remuneration. Finding a suitable agent, salary payment issues, distance from the construction site",
          "Over the past six months, I have struggled most with whether to participate in cross-field vocational training. Two months ago, I saw a promising training course for an emerging industry at home. If I participated, I was worried that after investing a lot of time and energy, I would have difficulty entering the industry due to lack of experience, which would also affect my job; if I did not participate, I was afraid of missing out on the opportunity for transformation and promotion. I discussed it with my family and colleagues, but everyone had different opinions, which made it even more difficult for me to make a decision. When making a decision, I was faced with the fact that the professional span was large and I was afraid that I would not be able to learn it; the training cost was high and the input-output ratio was uncertain; and the training period would reduce my rest and social time, affecting my life. These problems made me feel torn about whether to participate in the training or not, and I didn’t know how to take this step.",
          "This difficult decision was about my work. I used to work in engineering budgeting, but was laid off some time ago. I'm looking for a new job recently and I'm planning to switch to another industry. One of my classmates introduced me to their training institution as a course consultant. I also talked to the company's human resources specialist. Since I have passed the teacher qualification exam and tutor my own children, I'm familiar with the course and overall it's going relatively smoothly. For a while, I was very conflicted about choosing a new industry because I had already accepted my previous industry in my heart and couldn't let go of my old profession. On the other hand, the new job was also a challenge for me.",
          "The most difficult decision was whether to give up the stable job opportunity in my hometown and go to a first-tier city to work hard after graduating from college. It was during the college graduation season, and the location was in the school dormitory. The people involved were me and my parents. At that time, a company in my hometown offered me an olive branch, and the job was easy and the salary was stable. At the same time, I received an interview invitation from a well-known company in a first-tier city, which had great development space but fierce competition. My parents hoped that I would stay in my hometown, be with them all the time, and live a stable life. But I longed to go to a big city to pursue greater development. This put me in a dilemma, and I weighed the pros and cons repeatedly and struggled for a long time. When making this decision, I encountered the following specific problems: On the one hand, I was worried that it would be difficult to gain a foothold in first-tier cities, facing high living costs and high-intensity work pressure. If I failed, I would not only waste my time but also miss job opportunities in my hometown. On the other hand, although staying in my hometown was stable, I was unwilling to give up my dream and was afraid that I would regret not fighting for it in the future. Moreover, it was not easy to convince my parents to support my choice. Their worries made me feel more stressed and it was difficult to choose between emotions and ideals.",
          "This difficult decision was about the relocation of my family. 15 years ago, I was working in the city where I was working, and I wanted my family to come and live here and settle down permanently. The problems I encountered: 1. My hometown where I have lived for decades, my relatives and friends are all there, if I choose to leave, it means I will lose these relationships. 2. My parents also need to give up all their life relationships, come to a strange city to adapt to the environment, and start a new life. 3. How to settle down in a new city.",
          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision was whether to accept a promotion opportunity in a different location. Two months ago, the company talked to me and proposed to transfer me to a branch in a neighboring province as a department manager. The people involved were me and my direct supervisor. At that time, I was very conflicted. If I went, I would have career development, but I would be away from my family and friends and face challenges in a new environment; if I didn't go, I was worried about missing out on a rare opportunity. When making a decision, the specific problem is that it is difficult to balance career and family. I am worried that I can't take care of my family in a different place, and I am not sure whether I can adapt to the new work environment and interpersonal relationships. I have to weigh the pros and cons of staying or leaving, which is very painful.",
          "Last month, an HR in another city offered me a new job opportunity with a higher salary than my current level, but considering my long-term development and daily interactions with my family and friends, I eventually gave up the opportunity. Giving up a high-paying job in another city means that I have to seek breakthroughs in my original city, including technical capabilities and personal connections.",
          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision I have faced is whether to accept an overseas assignment. It involves me, my family, and the company's leadership. Last month, the company said that it urgently needed manpower for an overseas project and gave me a promotion opportunity. On the one hand, it was a rare career development opportunity, and on the other hand, I would be separated from my family for a long time. I was very conflicted and didn't know how to make a decision. When making the decision, I encountered many problems. I was worried that I would neglect to take care of my family if I was stationed abroad for a long time, and it would be difficult to grow my children and support my elders. Moreover, there were many uncertainties such as cultural differences and language barriers when working overseas, which made it difficult to carry out my work. At the same time, I was also worried about whether I could adapt to the pace of the domestic workplace after returning home.",
          "This difficult decision was about my own job. It happened on May 12, 2025. Because I was currently working in a job that was not what I liked. I really liked the job at my friend's company, so I asked him to keep an eye out for me. That day, he contacted me and said they were short of people and asked me to go directly. But it was so sudden that I couldn't leave immediately. So I made a difficult decision and didn't go to his company. When making a difficult decision, the problem I encountered was that his company would not buy insurance that month, and this company could not just go",
          "Changing careers. I used to work in sales, but I found that I didn't have good business skills and my income was always very low. After discussing with my family, I decided to change careers and do finance. There is a saying that you will be poor for half a year if you change jobs, but you will be poor for three years if you change careers. During this period, I need financial and emotional support from my family. Fortunately, my family supports me very much. They take the children out on weekends, allowing me to stay at home and study financial knowledge with peace of mind. This also laid a solid foundation for my subsequent job hopping. 1. Financial difficulties. Changing careers means starting from scratch. No matter how badly I did before, at least I had a guaranteed income. Now I have no income at all. 2. The difficulty of entering the industry. I changed careers very late, after I had a child. Many companies were unwilling to give you the opportunity to learn, so I asked for help everywhere and finally I got a chance to learn.",
          "Where to work? Should I choose to work in a first-tier city? When it comes to myself and my colleagues, we are caught in a difficult decision when deciding our work location. Working close to home has advantages but the salary level is lower. Working in a first-tier city has higher salary but is far from home. ① Consider the overall salary level and living pressure; ② Consider the distance from home; ③ Consider the relationship with family, etc."

          "\"I left my boyfriend who was caught cheating on me with another girl and then he came back to me saying that he was in love with me and it was a difficult decision for me to decide whether to start a relationship with him again or not. It happened in 2022. He was studying an engineering degree at the University of Moratuwa. In the beginning, he was very loving and honest with me and I trusted him a lot. He also loved me a lot in the beginning and we both supported each other and were pursuing our education. After a while, I heard that he was in a relationship with one of his friends and he was wrong but I loved him so much that I could not leave him. My parents also came to know about this and later they also agreed to this. After many incidents, I admitted his mistake and since he was not trying to get rid of it, I hardened my heart and stopped the relationship. After some time, he started a relationship again and did not make the same mistake again. I asked for forgiveness and asked him if I could forgive him and be with him again, if I could trust him again, if he would ruin my life, my mind was filled with questions, and I felt like the stress I was recovering from was coming back. I had a hard time making the right decision. I decided that I didn't want to be in a relationship with him again. He was really sad that if I started a relationship with him again, he would not do the same thing again and even gave me his Facebook password and did everything he could to build my trust, but when I remembered my past mistakes, I could not trust him. But I had a problem with whether I had made the right decision.

In the past six months, I realized that I am unable to bear this burden and the thoughts that are reflected in my environment, and as a result, others see me in a lower light. The problem is that I realized that I am the problem because I discovered that I have indirectly become addicted to this feeling. I felt that every good interaction I receive, I began to doubt, which makes the other party side with me and bypass me most of the time. After examining myself and I am still in the process of understanding my condition, I made the decision to live independently from my father, even though I am committed to my duties, such as bearing some of their living expenses. I am living in a difficult, yet empowering and necessary, moment of transition and transformation now. Although I prefer and love solitude, I am also a person who loves the good of everyone, even strangers.

It was mostly me and him, though two of my closest friends were also very supportive. It wasn't our first breakup; however, this time it was final. It was a very difficult decision for me because of all the memories we had together and our shared vision for the future. We thought a lot about moving in together, and we also talked about children, planning the house, its decor, our future jobs, and family. For the first few years, we lived in the same city, then we started a long-distance relationship, but we still saw each other every three months or so. It was very difficult for me mentally, also because we were friends before. I decided to break up with him because I found out he had cheated on me over six months ago and because of all the lies he told me. Over the last year of our relationship, many things came to light—the betrayal, the lies, the things he was hiding, and that was also very difficult for me. I also didn't understand how anyone could treat another person like that, especially me, who had tried so hard for him and done so much. My mind was telling me that maybe it wasn't the right decision. That I should reconsider, that we could continue working on the relationship. I wondered if I was really doing the right thing. I also fell into a brief depressive episode. After learning about the infidelity, my mental health deteriorated—I lost my appetite, cried constantly, became apathetic, had panic attacks, and practically didn't leave the house except for non-essential situations. I also felt like I couldn't really talk to anyone about it, because no one knew the situation from the inside like I did.

I realized I needed to pull away too, and I’d been thinking about it for quite some time. Five months ago, I decided to let go of this love completely, because it wasn’t going to work out. This decision was not made very quickly, it took me about 4 years to make this decision. During this time, I experienced different mental and physical problems. The reason I could not make this decision earlier was that we did not say goodbye in a normal way and I was chasing it.",

This happened in September 2022 in Caldas, Antioquia. This moment came a little over a year after discovering his infidelity.

I didn't dare to tell him the truth directly. Every time I play with him, I feel very tired and not very happy, so I rejected him. In his eyes, he and I are still good friends, and I don't want to expose it, so I was thinking of reasons to reject him. After I finally thought of rejecting him on the grounds of not having time, he still warmly invited me to go to his house again tomorrow. I wanted to reject him again, but there was really no reason, and seeing that he was so enthusiastic, I was embarrassed to refuse again.",

Neither of us had had any luck with music until now, and neither of us had ever been able to get anything done. Furthermore, while I had a job and a good income, he didn't. His mental state was also strained. He was completely reliant on this song. Even though the song was nearing completion, it never really came to fruition (because of him). After a while, his behavior became increasingly boundary-violating and manipulative, and I began to feel very uncomfortable. When I began to sense that our work wasn't going anywhere, I decided to part ways due to some disturbing behavior. The thought of abandoning him at such a difficult time in his life weighed heavily on me. I feared his mental state would deteriorate further. Furthermore, although I had lost faith in its completion, there was a song that was almost finished. I had put in a lot of effort, and it had always been my dream to produce my own song. Finally, because I, like him, had never been able to get my music right, the thought of it not working this time, of failing again, was incredibly difficult.

          "The most difficult decision I have ever made was probably filling out the college entrance examination application form. After all, this is really important. It was not long after the college entrance examination results were released. My parents, my father and a friend of my father were at my house. His son was a few years older than me and was admitted to a very good university, so he was more experienced. My father invited him to help, and we discussed it together at the table. I took out my book, which contained the scores of various schools in previous years and introduced many universities. After discussing it for an entire afternoon, we finally decided on 15 university places. Then in the evening, I logged into the computer and started filling out the application form. When I was filling out the application form, I felt that time was really long because each decision on the order of places was very difficult. I was very confused when filling out the application form. I didn't know what the best order of placement for each school should be, and I didn't know what major I should choose for each school. Since I didn't have any particular career in mind at the time, the process of filling out the application was particularly difficult. It was really a long night. In the end, I listened to my dad's arrangements and chose a major that he thought was better.",

Our son's math teacher often made mistakes in explaining and correcting some questions, so my wife and I discussed changing the school for our child. The new school was a little far from home, and the school arrival and departure times conflicted with our work schedule, so we decided to ask the elderly in our family to come and help pick him up. I am worried about my child's adaptation; the elderly at home have to sacrifice their rest time to come and help; the distance is also far.",
          "Even though I sent my daughter to the best preschool in the province, I had to transfer her to another school because of a teacher there. The teacher had started to scold and yell at her for no reason. Exactly one month later, the child refused to go to preschool. It was very difficult for me to make a decision. I removed the child and transferred her to a new preschool in May of this year. How can I resolve this problem peacefully without causing a conflict with the teacher?",

I have to make a decision about the postgraduate entrance examination and employment, which involves me and my family. The problem I encountered was that I didn’t want to study anymore, but my parents insisted that I take the postgraduate entrance examination and continue studying so that I could find a good job. However, I wanted to get a job directly. Facing my parents’ orders, it was difficult for me to refute and change their views. This was the specific problem I encountered.",

At that time, I was doing my graduation internship, but if I wanted to prepare for the postgraduate entrance examination in philosophy, I had to prepare for my exam, but I was very busy at work and couldn't study well. I needed to make a choice. Either give up the idea of postgraduate entrance examination immediately and start to submit resumes for the autumn recruitment, or study hard. However, although I love philosophy, I have never thought about what will happen after studying this major? How to find a job in this field to support my own life? At that time, I was facing heavy internship work pressure while planning my future route. It was difficult to make a decision. 1. Not preparing for the exam well, no hope of passing the postgraduate entrance exam; 2. High work pressure and insufficient time; 3. Lack of work experience and worry about the autumn recruitment; 4.

If you intern in the province where your school is located, there are fewer internship resources and the value is not high.

          "I made my difficult decision when it came to choosing a school for my high school education. Because all my teachers and elders in the community told me to enroll in the city school. The problem was that my family's economy was not strong enough to afford it. Also, my friends were not in the city school. But I thought about the opportunities I would get from the city school.

At that time, I was on vacation at home. My mother never had any hope for my academic performance. She said that I should go to work, and what was the point of going to school. I argued with her for a long time. I insisted on going to junior college, and then I chose to go to junior college. Fortunately, my father supported me and paid for me to finish college, so that my horizons could be broadened. After graduation, I was very glad that I insisted on going to college. The problem I encountered was my mother's lack of understanding. She had a traditional concept that girls were not good enough, that I was stupid, and that I was just bad at math. She concluded that I would never be good enough in life. Also, my parents were old, and there was the issue of money. Fortunately, my father allowed me to finish college, and I persevered no matter how hard it was.",

My results did not meet my expectations, so \"whether to repeat a year\" was the most difficult decision I had ever made. I want to repeat a year because my grades are not good. I expected that I could go to an ordinary second-tier university, but my actual score can only allow me to go to a junior college. The tuition for junior college is very high and my family cannot afford it. I am hesitant because my homeroom teacher strongly advises me not to repeat a year. He thinks that repeating a year will not improve my grades and it is a waste of time. Moreover, my city does not accept repeaters. I can only go to a private school in the next city. The tuition is also very expensive, more than 10,000 yuan per semester.",

After graduating from university, I found a very good job with a high income and relatively harmonious interpersonal relationships in the company. However, I did not like the content of this job very much and was very confused for a while because I myself prefer computer science. After struggling for half a year, I decided to continue to take the postgraduate entrance examination. At that time, my family was against it. The most difficult problem is that I am a girl and I have already started working. If I want to continue my postgraduate studies, even if I can pass the exam successfully, I will be older after graduation and will face the pressure of finding a partner and having children, which makes me very conflicted. In addition, my family’s financial situation is not very good and my parents have already retired. It is a bit beyond their ability to continue to support me in my postgraduate studies.",

I was very conflicted. If I agree to let my child repeat a grade, I am worried that he will be treated differently in class and his self-confidence will be affected.

It was winter break, and my mother asked me about my future plans. Knowing the challenging job market, she suggested I pursue postgraduate study to further my education and gain a better edge in future job hunting. A classmate of mine also discussed the choice of employment or postgraduate study with me. She felt that both of us weren't academically inclined, so we should both choose employment over postgraduate study. Indeed, after careful consideration, I decided to pursue employment over postgraduate study. When considering employment, I need to consider specific areas. I need to conduct background checks on companies and understand what positions my major is suitable for. How should I answer relevant interview questions for these positions? I also need to consider social insurances and housing funds, company policies, and future career plans.",

After the transfer system opened in April, I had no interest in applying for the program because my failure to get into my first choice was a major blow. Just as I'd decided to give up and had already applied on various recruitment platforms, I couldn't sleep that night. I wondered if I really had to give up, but I kept wondering if fate was still hoping I'd give it a try. So, I applied to several transfer schools. Applying for transfer schools was already a daunting task. Later, I received re-examination invitations from three schools, and I began to struggle even more. Each school had different procedures. Some were in-person, which I didn't feel like running. Others were online, but the initial exam booklet wasn't what I'd prepared for. Furthermore, under the pressure of time, my mind was a blur. I still admire my courage back then. I rejected two of them, telling myself, \"There's only one left. Either accept it or go back to work.\" Fortunately, the gamble paid off.",

But after the results came, that school asked her to do her Advanced Level in the Commerce stream and to do her Advanced Level in the Arts stream, saying that her results were not good enough. Despite trying as much as possible, it was finally decided to admit her daughter to another school. That school gave her the opportunity to appear for her Advanced Level in the Commerce stream.

When making a decision, on the one hand, I was afraid that I would not be admitted to a prestigious school and would waste a year; on the other hand, I was unwilling to choose a local school because I felt that it would not be a challenge.

          "When I was filling out my college entrance examination application, I was struggling for a long time between art and science and engineering. I personally prefer art, but my family said it would be difficult to find a job there, so after a difficult ideological struggle, I finally chose science and engineering. My family elders talked to me and pointed out that finding a job is difficult these days and that I should prioritize career-friendly majors. Some of my classmates applied for art programs, but they came from well-off families. Considering my current situation, I chose to compromise.",

          "When my son was choosing a university, I had a difficult time deciding. He was in a dilemma filling out his university application: he wanted to go to Tianjin, while I wanted him to go to Sichuan or Wuhan. We each had our reasons, but neither could fully convince the other. First, there's the issue of climate adaptation. Tianjin is located in the north and is dry. Wuhan and Chengdu, on the other hand, have climates similar to my hometown. Furthermore, transportation is much farther from Tianjin than the other two cities. However, my son believes in his teacher's recommendations for Tianjin schools, so he wants to go there.",
          "After the Henan college entrance examination results came out, I was confused about what major I should choose, what major would make money, what major would suit me, and a series of other things about where I should go in the future. I didn't know anything. I remember very clearly that when the college entrance examination results came out, we had to start filling out the application form immediately. My father, my mother, my sister, and I were all there, sitting on the sofa in my living room, looking at my average score. Everyone was confused. I was the first college student in my family, and the highest education level of the others was only junior high school, and some even had never been to school. We held the very thick application form issued by the school, looking confused. In the end, my father called a relative who was not too close to him (a professor at a well-known university) to give some advice. 1. I don’t know what majors are needed in today’s era, what I am good at, what I should choose, what I should do next, etc. 2. The relative my father contacted did not respond before the last day of application (to be more precise, it was two hours and five minutes before the application deadline, I remember it very clearly). 3. After reading the exaggerated words on the Internet, teachers, and friends, I don’t know what to do in the end",
          "The most difficult decision was choosing a major for college. I was the only one involved in the selection process, with no one to offer advice. I had to complete the online application form at home within a specified week. No one could give me proper advice. I didn’t know what majors were available, what the employment situation was like, and what the courses would entail. I also didn’t know where to get information about the majors.",
          "So far, the most difficult decision in my life was whether I should give up the existing offer and wait for an unknown offer when I applied for doctoral admission. It was already September, and I had participated in the application assessment for top2 doctoral admission, but the results had not been announced. According to previous experience, the results would not be announced until November. At the same time, I participated in the doctoral admission interview of my own school (a mid-level 985 university). After the interview, my future supervisor sent me a text message saying that he was willing to admit me, but only gave me one week to consider it. Once I agreed, I could not regret it. During this week, I was very entangled, whether to give up the unknown result and choose the current sure opportunity. My parents also persuaded me to accept the offer of my own school. I hesitated for a week, and finally rejected the opportunity to study for a doctorate at my own school and chose to continue waiting for the interview results of the top2 university. In the end, my decision was right. The specific question is whether I should give up the 985 doctoral study opportunity which is almost certain to win and is also good, and wait for the illusory top 2 interview result. The persuasion of my parents and friends makes it very difficult for me to make the decision.",
          "The most difficult decision I've made over the past six months has been whether to abandon my three months of preparation for the postgraduate entrance exam and take over my family's small supermarket, which is on the verge of bankruptcy. In February of this year, my father suffered a heart attack and was hospitalized. My mother was no longer able to support the supermarket on her own. My first round of the postgraduate entrance exam had just passed, and the re-examination was in April. It involved me, my hospitalized father, my anxious mother, and the senior student who was tutoring me for the re-examination. I was running back and forth between the hospital, the supermarket, and my rental apartment. When my father was lucid, he'd always say, \"Leave the supermarket alone,\" while my mother secretly wiped away tears, and my senior student urged me to study for the re-examination. I was reluctant to give up the postgraduate entrance exam, after all, I had invested a lot of time in it. If I didn't take over, my parents' efforts might be wasted, and my father's condition might be affected. There was also a time conflict, making it difficult to balance the re-examination preparations with the supermarket business.",

          "When I applied for the college entrance examination, I checked my scores at the company where I was working during the summer vacation. My scores just passed the passing line, so I was faced with the choice of a school. If I chose the university I liked, I would risk being rejected and might only be able to go to a junior college. My parents said it's up to me to make my own choice, but I'm torn between taking a risk or taking the safe option.",
          "My mother, my brother, my sister-in-law, the time period for filling out college entrance examination applications in 2021, my family filled out the application form for me with reference to the score range. Should the school be chosen within or outside the province, and should it be far or near from home?",
          "When I graduated from college, I didn’t get into my favorite school and major because my postgraduate entrance exam scores were not ideal. I had to apply for transfer. Two schools sent me offers and I had to choose one of them. I was very confused and no one could enlighten me. It was really the darkest moment of my life. Because the majors of the two schools were not my forte, when I made the choice, I felt that I was not completely sure that I could pass it. I even thought about reviewing for a year if it didn't work out.",
          "We didn't agree with the school administration. The administration doesn't want to listen to the parents. They changed the class teacher during the holidays, without even asking the parents' opinion. They did it because of one parent who had been insulting the teacher for a year.",
          "The difficult decision I made was whether to transfer my child to another primary school. The primary school my child is currently attending has poor teaching staff, a bad learning atmosphere in the class, and my child's grades are not ideal. The last time I chatted with my neighbors in the community, I learned that there is a key primary school in the neighboring area with vacant places. This school has good teaching quality and rich learning resources. However, there are many problems with transferring. The new school is far from home, and it takes a lot of time to pick up and drop off every day. I am worried that my child will have psychological pressure when he leaves his familiar teachers and classmates. After repeated discussions with my family, everyone disagreed, which put me in a difficult decision. Problems encountered: 1 It takes 40 minutes to drive from home to the school. My wife and I are busy at work, so picking up and dropping off the children has become a big problem. The elderly in the family are old, and there are safety hazards in traveling. The school bus does not match our commuting time, so it is troublesome to connect. 2 The child is introverted and has just made some good friends. Transferring to a new school means re-adapting to the class environment, the teaching style of the new teacher, etc., which will affect the child's mental health. 3 The teaching progress of the new school may be different from that of the original school, and I am afraid that I can't keep up with the progress of the new school. If I stay in the original school, I am worried that the poor learning environment will continue to affect the child's academic development.",
          "The first difficult decision that came to mind was changing my daughter's kindergarten. I was worried about whether my daughter, who is only 3 years old, would be able to adapt to the new kindergarten. The reason for the change was that a new director had come to the previous kindergarten and was changing many things. I was worried about my daughter's well-being and whether she would be able to adapt to the new environment. However, since my daughter is a quick communicator, I had high hopes.",
          "It was probably because of the different employment options I faced during graduation season last year that made it difficult to make a decision. The people who helped me make these decisions and gave me advice included my parents, classmates, and teachers. This happened between May and July 2024. At that time, I had already received an offer to become a teacher at a public college, but the salary was not what I expected, and there were also some uncertainties. At that point, I had no other options that were certain, so it felt difficult to make a decision. 1. Should I stick with my current choice? 2. On the one hand, there’s a voice telling me: the current employment situation is very grim, and there’s a job as a teacher that’s decent and stable, so I must stick with it. 3. On the other hand, there’s a voice deep down inside: Do I really not want to try other options that are more in line with my expectations, even if there are uncertainties?",
          "About choosing a school for the child. In October 2023, I worried for a long time about which school to choose for my child. It is also very important to go from kindergarten to primary school, because the situation here is divided by region. The schools in our region can only go to the sixth grade. After junior high school, we have to face the lottery decision. If you are unlucky, you will be drawn to a not-so-good middle school, which will be very difficult in the future. And there is also a very good primary school near us, which has a junior high school department and the teaching quality is also very good. My husband and I have different opinions. I want my child to go to a better school, but I need to buy a school district house again. It is difficult for our family conditions to afford another school district house. My husband's opinion is to let the child go to the primary school in our current area, and the child's future will depend on the child's own efforts. We struggled for more than two months at the time, and finally chose my husband's method. I faced many problems when making this difficult decision. My husband disagreed with me, my family was short of money, and I couldn't get over the hurdle in my heart. I was afraid that I would regret it in the future. I was also afraid that my children would have a hard time in the future.",

To admit that he needs to receive inclusive education. It happened in the winter. In the middle of the school year. I transferred my child from 1 to the zero grade for tutoring. The attitude of other parents changed a lot. Other parents forbade their children to even communicate with my son. My child is no different from other children. The problems were that you have to register for the PMPC in advance. You wait for your turn for several months. There is no registration for a special school. Because there are no available places. And the school does not have tutors or special education teachers.",
          "So far, I have made the decision whether to continue studying after failing the college entrance examination.

Description: Mainly from the end of March to mid-April this year, I was at home with my parents, constantly searching for transfer opportunities. ① The difficulty of finding a job without the status of a recent graduate + a liberal arts background ② Questions about whether it is possible to succeed in the postgraduate entrance examination for the third time ③ Whether to choose a transfer school if the transfer school is not as good as the undergraduate school",

          "June 2021 was my last month at university. At that time, I was struggling with the choice of taking the postgraduate entrance examination or finding a job. This was a relatively important and difficult decision for me, because the social and economic environment at that time was downward, and many people faced the problem of unemployment after graduation. At that time, my roommates and I discussed this decision in the school dormitory, and finally we chose to continue to take the postgraduate entrance examination to improve our academic qualifications. I encountered five specific problems: 1. The school needs us, who are not sure about where to go after graduation, to give an answer as soon as possible about whether to find a job or continue to study. 2. The difficulty of the postgraduate entrance examination increases every year, and the number of applicants increases. I am not sure whether I can successfully pass the entrance examination. 3. The employment situation is very bad. It is difficult to find a job without a high degree, but if the economic situation continues to decline in the future, even with a high degree, it is not certain that you will find a job. 4. Postgraduate study requires a lot of money. Are our parents able to help us pay for the tuition and living expenses during the postgraduate stage? 5. Postgraduate study has certain difficulties, and I am not sure that I can graduate on time.",

          "It was probably time to fill out my college entrance exam application. My scores were awkward, so I couldn't get into a particularly good school, but I wasn't willing to accept a poor one. Furthermore, my parents insisted I choose a major they thought was good and safe. I didn't want to choose any of those, so I had a huge argument with them. We decided it was best to apply to both and see which of our preferred majors would get me accepted. Specifically, it was already a headache for me to choose the college and major, and my parents did not agree with my choice of major and wanted to make the decision for me.",
          "Regarding my path to graduate school, whether to take the recommendation or prepare for the exam, at the beginning of this year (the second semester of my junior year), the school changed the recommendation policy, so that the two national-level awards I had won before no longer added points (according to the previous policy, my chances of recommendation were very high, so I did not prepare for the relevant review for the graduate school entrance examination). According to the new recommendation policy, I was on the edge. At that time, I was working on a project with my teacher and preparing for another competition. If I decided to take the graduate school entrance examination, then the preparation for this project and the competition would have to be stopped, and the previous efforts would be in vain; if I decided to take the recommendation, there would also be a lot of uncertainty, because the school did not announce the number of recommended places, and I didn’t know whether other students had extra points for scientific research or competitions, and I didn’t know whether I could get a place. Both choices have their disadvantages. If I choose to take the postgraduate entrance examination, it seems a little late because I had no preparation before, and I have to give up the project and the competition, which I am reluctant to do; if I choose to be admitted to graduate school, there will be too much uncertainty, and the longer I delay the decision, the more serious it will become. I must make a choice as soon as possible.",
          "After graduating from university, I faced the difficult decision of whether to work or continue studying for a master's degree. It was in June 2017, at home, with the participation of my parents. At that time, I received an employment notice from a company with good salary and benefits. At the same time, I also passed the postgraduate re-examination. My parents were worried about the subsequent employment situation and hoped that I could work first and then continue my studies. I weighed the pros and cons in my mind and it was difficult to make a choice. On the one hand, there is uncertainty in information. It is impossible to accurately predict the changing trend of the employment situation in the next few years. I don’t know whether I can find a satisfactory job after graduating from graduate school. On the other hand, there is uncertainty in career planning and development. Parents and relatives and friends cannot give good advice. I am not sure whether I should accumulate experience through work first or obtain a higher degree to help long-term development.",

Three weeks ago, in the student union office, the student union was changing terms and I had the potential to remain as the director. At the same time, the college was organizing academic competitions, and my teammates strongly invited me to join. I was still struggling over whether to continue the growth path of the student union or to devote myself to the competition. On the one hand, I am afraid of quitting the student union and missing out on the opportunity to accumulate management experience and expand my network, as well as betraying the trust of my seniors. On the other hand, the competition is stressful and I am afraid that I will invest time without achieving results. I want to do both, but it is difficult to decide between the two.",

I compiled the most promising areas of the city where I planned to buy an apartment, then made a list of reliable developers with high-quality construction. Every day I studied the offers of a certain developer from my list. I went and called banks to find out the most favorable conditions for myself. Having decided on an apartment, I contacted the developer's manager and then found out that they only issue loans for apartments on the first and last floors. Disappointed, I wanted to give up on this idea, but then decided to look for an apartment on the secondary market. I found the apartment exactly what I wanted - the area, the developer, the number of floors, the square footage satisfied everything. The seller turned out to be a nice woman psychologist, we immediately agreed on the price. She agreed to wait a little with the loan. I arranged some days off from work, bought tickets to the city where I bought the apartment.

I would not want to eat only bread and drink boiling water at 60 years old or sit on the neck of my nephews... The worries were strong, I did not sleep and did not eat.

The apartment was freshly renovated, with furniture. Now I have been paying the mortgage for almost half a year and, it seems, there are no financial problems. The problems were that I was planning to buy real estate in another city, I couldn’t see the apartment in person, I also encountered the fact that the same bank provided different advice, despite the age of technology I couldn’t fully understand the terms of the loan, in addition, there were problems with arranging days off, they didn’t want to give me days off and the most important thing was the fear of losing my financial balance.",

Leaving me without a new device and another 5 business days to wait until the money spent on its purchase is returned. But I was already in the mood for this device, so I start looking for other possible ways to purchase it. Which led me to TaoBao, making a direct purchase from China and another wait. And the time window for possible phone verification was getting smaller, later the law was postponed for 1 month, which allowed activating the phone without possible network blocking. 1. Waiting - nothing is more annoying than a long and languid wait for the result 2. The marketplace scam - OZON at that moment turned out to be a dishonest platform for me, which doesn't care, the order was canceled because they want it that way 3. With the fear that the phone will be stolen at the post office - although I'm still young, I have already encountered the negativity of Kazpost, SDEk and other companies, they lost my parcels, once someone even opened the parcel and stole electronics from it worth more than 120,000 tenge (as of 2018) 4. Incompleteness and inconvenience of the phone verification service - in order to carry out the service, it was necessary to register using only an electronic digital signature, although nowadays everyone uses QR codes, and also the fact that on the site, when verifying the OnePlus brand in the phone brand field, the site's prompts gave false information, it turns out that it was necessary to write \"1+\" and not \"Oneplus\". And all this took about more than 60 days.",

This decision was difficult because it involved finances, large sums of money I didn't have, and the commitment of a 30-year mortgage with rather hefty payments. Financial problems were paramount – lack of funds and the need to sell the apartment at a specific price, which didn't generate much interest from potential buyers.

I chose to stay home and not go anywhere, but I'm still not sure that it was the right decision. Because the university I was planning to go to was my dream. Now I don't want to regret what I missed, but sometimes such thoughts arise. The problem was that studying far away from home opened up many opportunities for me. But being alone in a big city, without family, friends and relatives, seemed too scary. At the same time, staying in my city, I gave up my dream.

The opportunity arose for us to get tickets for next to nothing, with only accommodation and food on our shoulders. This opportunity arose two and a half months before my boyfriend's group of friends were scheduled to travel. My boyfriend was very keen on it, booking hotels the same day and telling me when the departure and arrival times were. Since it would be my first time flying, I even got an offer to fly from one city to another in Poland. I had plenty of ideas, but I had a lot of doubts. There were many problems deciding whether to go or not. Mostly related to me. Perhaps for some, this wouldn't be difficult, but for me, I lived on tranquilizers for the first few days. The first problem was that I wasn't prepared for anything. It was supposed to be a long trip, almost three weeks, and I was already focused on a seaside vacation and taking care of my health. I almost panicked. In addition, there was the fear of the flight itself, of traveling with people I barely knew. I struggled with the thought that someone important to me cared about this. Besides, I wasn't financially prepared either. This year was the year I fixed my health, didn't take on extra work to relax. I didn't want my boyfriend to cover it for me. I had a financial cushion, but it wasn't much and would practically disappear. Another problem was the lack of so many vacation days. I would have had next to nothing left until the end of the year, and I always had those three or four days left over. And finally, other people's vacations. It turned out that autumn is very attractive for a holiday and two other people wanted to go somewhere in October.",

Now I will leave her the role of door and mother, if not bear the financial burden as well if the immigration adventure does not succeed. This was the biggest challenge. Then comes the challenge of facing the unknown: Will I succeed in finding a job at this age? Will I be able to repay my debts and return to my country and family? Or will I only add immigration debts to my existing debts?

I'm a very diligent student with a high GPA, and this was a chance for me. After much persuasion, we decided I'd move away for university and see how it went.

          "The most difficult decision: whether to give up the opportunity to study abroad to take care of a seriously ill family member Time: August 2018 Location: Beijing (home) and Boston, USA (location of the admitted school) People involved: me (22 years old, a fresh graduate), my mother (cancer patient), my father, my boyfriend (now husband), and a study abroad agent Background: In the spring of 2018, I received an admission letter from the School of Communication at Boston University in the United States (full scholarship), and planned to go to the United States in September to pursue a master's degree. At the same time, my mother was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer during a routine physical examination and needed to be hospitalized for chemotherapy immediately. My father was stationed abroad for a long time due to the nature of his work, and the responsibility of taking care of my mother fell almost entirely on me. Key conflicts and details: The fierce collision between family responsibilities and personal ideals: After my mother learned about her illness, she insisted that I \"don't give up my dream\" and even secretly contacted the agent to inquire about the possibility of delayed enrollment; but my father told me privately that the doctor assessed that my mother's remaining survival period might be less than two years. \"She doesn't say it, but she counts the time when you go home every day.\" My boyfriend (who had been in love for 3 years at the time) works in Beijing and said, \"I can move in with you to take care of aunt, but you have to think clearly. Giving up this opportunity may mean missing out on the top resources in the industry forever.\" (He is in the international consulting industry and knows the impact of academic qualifications on career development) The double pressure of reality: My mother's treatment requires huge expenses (targeted drugs cost 32,000 yuan per month out of pocket), and my undergraduate savings are only enough to pay for 3 months of expenses. If I go to the United States, I need to start the house selling procedure immediately, but my father firmly opposes (the property is my mother's pre-marital property and carries her childhood memories). Boston University stipulates that \"scholarship quotas cannot be retained until the next year\". If you give up that year, you will need to reapply at your own expense in the future (estimated cost exceeds 800,000 yuan). The feeling of tearing in the decision-making process: While accompanying my mother in the hospital for two consecutive weeks, I hid in the stairwell every morning to communicate with the professor via Skype, trying to \"complete the first semester course remotely\", but was rejected by the hospital on the grounds that \"media majors need to participate in projects on site\". During the interval between my mother's chemotherapy, my father quietly helped me pack my luggage, but when I found out, he turned his back and said, \"Your mother has never lived for herself in her life. Don't let her feel that she is a burden to you.\" This sentence made me break down and cry in the corridor of the ward. The final decision: A week before school started, I submitted an application to Boston University to give up admission, and quietly placed a copy of the admission letter on my mother's bedside. That night, she touched the paper and choked and said, \"I'm sorry.\" I held her hand with an IV tube and replied, \"You grew up with me, and I grew old with you. This is not an exchange, but what I want to do most.\" Conflict between family responsibilities and personal ideals: taking care of a seriously ill mother vs. studying in the United States (full scholarship + top resources). Financial pressure: high cost of treatment (targeted drugs cost 32,000 yuan/month), disagreement on selling the house (father opposes selling mother's pre-marital property). Timeliness of opportunity: scholarship quota cannot be retained, and it needs to be re-paid at one's own expense after giving up (estimated to be over 800,000 yuan). Emotional tug: mother insisted on letting me go, father hinted that she didn't have much time left, boyfriend reminded of career risks. Uncertainty about the future: giving up studying abroad may affect the starting point of career, and staying requires planning life from scratch.",

          "A 35-year-old project manager faces a choice between career and family. During the lockdown in Shanghai in 2023, he encountered the following at the same time: 1) The company assigned him to be responsible for an important project of the Singapore branch (for a period of 2 years) 2) His wife had just been diagnosed with early breast cancer and needed treatment 3) His 8-year-old son was in the critical period of transitioning from primary school to junior high school. Difficulties in decision-making: • Career opportunities: Cross-border projects can bring double salary and promotion opportunities • Family responsibilities: The wife needs company for treatment, and the child's education requires a stable environment • Time pressure: The company requires a reply within a week • Economic considerations: Overseas income can better cover medical expenses Participants: Wife (prefers her husband to stay) Company executives (pressured to accept the assignment) Attending physician (explains treatment options) Child's class teacher (feeds back on matters needing attention for further studies) Final solution: After family meetings and expert consultations, he chose: 1) Negotiate with the company to shorten the assignment to 1 year 2) Hire a professional caregiver to assist his wife with treatment 3) Transfer his son to an international school to maintain educational continuity 4) Return to China to visit relatives every two months ‌1. Difficulties in evaluation caused by information opacity‌ • Medical level: At the time, it was impossible to determine how long the wife’s chemotherapy cycle would actually take (the doctor estimated 6-12 months), and the risk of recurrence after surgery was controversial (15%-30% different experts said) • Career level: The company hinted that \"refusing an overseas assignment may affect subsequent promotions\", but did not provide a written commitment to guarantee this • Education level: There is uncertainty about the number of transfer places at international schools, and the change in curriculum system may require an adaptation period ‌2. Conflicting demands of stakeholders‌ Wife’s needs Company’s needs Child’s needs ‌Explicit demands‌ Accompanying treatment Project delivery Stable environment ‌Implicit demands‌ Sense of security Loyalty test Fatherly role model Focus of conflict: Overseas phone calls when the wife had a nighttime breakdown vs. the overlapping early morning meeting for the Singapore project ‌3. Dilemma in risk assessment‌ • Financial calculation: Overseas salary (approximately 1.8 million yuan/year before tax) vs. the out-of-pocket cost of domestic treatment (approximately 400,000 yuan/year) • Opportunity cost: If refused, the qualification to participate in international business may be permanently lost; if accepted, the wife’s depression scale will show a high risk • Moral dilemma: The traditional belief of \"saving lives is more important than making money\" raised by my parents-in-law contradicts the attending physician's professional advice that \"medical technology allows for remote consultations.\" ‌4. Time pressure for decision-making: The company's 72-hour response deadline overlaps with the second oncology consultation. The transfer application deadline for my son's school is in 5 days. The rental contract expires and a decision on whether to renew must be made within 10 days. ‌5. Shaken self-perception‌ • Reconstructing values: Suddenly realizing the fundamental contradiction between my \"career elite\" persona and my \"family pillar\" role • Questioning my ability: Did I overestimate my cross-border coordination skills?

          "In 2021, my husband and I had worked in the same company for many years. At that time, most of the company's business was being transferred to the company's headquarters in other places, and my husband and I were going to work in other companies together. At this time, my 66-year-old father had a sudden cerebral hemorrhage and was hospitalized and underwent surgery. Even after being discharged from the hospital, he still needed someone to take care of him. My mother was also weak, and there was a real shortage of manpower at home. As an only child, I was caught in a dilemma of taking care of my sick parents and working. During that time, I had to work overtime every day to complete a local work task. I also had to consider whether I could work in other places. I also had to go to the hospital. I felt like I was torn apart. My colleagues and leaders advised me to find a nanny for my family. I seized the good job opportunity. My mother always said that she could take care of my father. But I always saw the tiredness on my mother's face and my father lying on the hospital bed. One day, I suddenly realized that money can be earned slowly, but some moments are really gone if you miss them. In the end, I applied to a company with very little business in the local area. Although the salary was reduced, I made the right choice to accompany my parents who have been sick for many years.",

          "1. Scene review: Winter of 2018, ICU ward of Municipal Hospital Characters: I (32 years old, female): I was abused by my father since I was a child. My mother died in a car accident due to my father's alcoholism at the age of 16. Since then, I have severed ties with my father and lived alone in another place. Father (58 years old): He was in the late stage of liver cirrhosis. When he was sober, he asked relatives to convey his \"want to apologize\" many times, but he never said it in person. Aunt: My father's sister, who has taken care of me since I was a child, insisted that \"blood is thicker than water\", and hoped that I would see my father for the last time. Attending doctor: Informed that \"there are at most two weeks left\", and suggested that the family be mentally prepared. Key events: When I received the call from my aunt, I was at the airport preparing to fly abroad on a business trip. A photo of my father lying on the hospital bed popped up on the screen of my mobile phone - he was so thin that he was unrecognizable, with a nasogastric tube extending from his nasal cavity to his chest, and his right wrist still had the scars from my scratches when I was abused many years ago. My aunt cried on the phone and said, \"He wakes up at three in the morning every day, staring at the ceiling and reading your name.\" I sat on a bench in the airport lobby for three hours, with two tickets in front of me: one was a business class flight to Paris that night, and the project was about to be signed, which was a key opportunity for my career advancement; the other was an economy class flight back to my hometown half an hour later, and after landing, I had to take a two-hour bus to get to the hospital. Suddenly, a screenshot of the news on the day of my mother's car accident popped up on my phone (this is a memory I dare not touch for many years): my father drove drunk and hit the guardrail, and my mother died on the spot to protect me, the co-pilot, but he was only slightly injured. In court, he screamed at the judge, \"Anyway, my daughter is not my own,\" and this sentence was like a knife engraved into my heart, becoming a wound that will never heal. 1. The stranglehold of emotion and reason Reason told me: He used a belt to beat my textbooks, smashed my glasses the night before my high school entrance exam, and even drunkenly said \"I'll save you trouble if you die\" at my mother's funeral. Such a person is not worthy of forgiveness. But my emotions are wavering: my aunt sent me a video - my father trembled and wrote the three words \"I'm sorry\" with his left hand, and the ink was blurred by tears. It was the first time he wrote an apology letter, and I waited for these three words for 16 years. 2. The countdown of time The attending doctor said: \"He is now sometimes awake and sometimes unconscious, and he may not be able to wait for you to come back tomorrow.\" The project leader in Paris sent a message: \"If you don't fly tonight, the partner may turn to a competitor. This is the opportunity you have been waiting for three years.\" The airport broadcast broadcasts flight information every ten minutes. I watched the second hand on the clock jump, and every beat was like a blow to my heart. 3. The collapse of self-identity If you choose to forgive: does it mean betraying your mother's death? Should I deny all the sufferings I had endured in the past to escape from him? My friend said, \"You forgive him, but you are only satisfying his desire for atonement, not really letting yourself go.\" If I choose to leave: Will I be devoured by guilt for the rest of my life? When I become a mother, can I face my child asking \"What kind of person is grandpa?\" 3. The ultimate torture that cannot be avoided In the airport bathroom, I stared at my pale self in the mirror and suddenly remembered what I wrote in my diary when I was 17 years old: \"I want to be the exact opposite of him and never be controlled by hatred.\" The choice at this moment is no longer a simple \"go or not\", but: What kind of person do I want to be? A victim defined by pain, or a survivor who can transcend the harm? Is forgiveness equal to forgetting? If forgiveness is to free oneself, rather than to glorify his faults, is it justified? What is the weight of blood relationship? Does the biological father-daughter relationship necessarily come with emotional obligations? 4. Final Choice and Aftermath I tore up my ticket to Paris, sent a note of \"I'm sorry\" to the project team at the boarding gate, and then walked to the security checkpoint for the flight from my hometown. When I arrived at the hospital, my father had fallen into a coma. I held his needle-streaked hand and remembered the last unsent text message from my mother before she died: \"Nannan, Dad said today that he would quit drinking. He said that when you get into college, he would take you to Beijing to see the Great Wall.\" At five in the morning, the monitor beeped for a long time. A tear slid down the corner of his eye, but I didn't say \"I forgive you\" after all. Later, when I sorted out his belongings, I found a tattered account book under his pillow. The page in 1998 read: \"My daughter wants to learn painting, save money to buy paint - 32 yuan.\" That year, his monthly salary was only 400 yuan, and I finally gave up the art exam because of his opposition. 5. What this decision taught me There is no perfect choice: I lost the opportunity for promotion, but received a call from a strange woman at his funeral - she is my biological mother, who left home because of my father's alcoholism. In order to keep me, my father lied that I was \"adopted\". Pain will be redefined, but it will not disappear: I still see him raising the belt in nightmares, but the difference is that I no longer need to prove that I live a better life by \"hating him\". The essence of reconciliation is self-salvation: not for him, but for the 16-year-old self who is trapped to truly walk into the sun.",

          "The most difficult decision was whether to take my mother, who suffers from a serious chronic disease, away from her familiar living environment and go to a strange city with more abundant medical resources for long-term treatment. The people involved at that time were me, my father, my mother, and my mother's attending physician. It was a winter day about three years ago, and the location was at my mother's home. After my mother was diagnosed with a serious chronic disease, after a period of treatment in a local hospital, although her condition was under control, she could not get a more effective cure. After a detailed communication with me, the attending physician suggested that we consider going to a city with a higher level of medical care, where there are more advanced medical equipment and richer treatment experience, which may bring a new turn for my mother's condition. However, my mother has a deep affection for the home where she has lived all her life, and she is reluctant to leave her familiar neighbors, friends and daily rhythm of life; my father is worried about my mother's condition on the one hand, and on the other hand, he is concerned about the inconveniences of life in a new city; and I, as a child, hope to get better treatment opportunities for my mother, but I also know that this decision will bring great changes to the whole family. The mother's emotions and wishes: My mother's attachment to her hometown is very strong. She is afraid that she will feel lonely and helpless in the new city. She is worried that life will become boring without her familiar social circle. She feels that in the current environment, at least there are old neighbors who can occasionally chat and participate in some community activities together. Moreover, she is worried that her physical condition cannot adapt to the changes in the new environment. This makes me very entangled. I want to respect her wishes, but I don't want to miss the treatment opportunities that may help her condition. The problem of family financial burden: Living in a new city means bearing higher living costs, including rent, medical expenses, daily expenses, etc. Although the new city has abundant medical resources, the corresponding treatment costs may also be higher. Although our family's original financial situation can maintain basic living, I still feel great pressure when facing such an additional expense. I need to carefully weigh the family's financial affordability to ensure that the family will not fall into financial difficulties because of this decision. The problem of father's life adaptation: My father has become accustomed to the current lifestyle. He has his own social circle and daily activities. If the whole family moves to a new city, he needs to re-establish his own life circle, which is also a big challenge for him. I am worried that my father will feel uncomfortable with the change in living environment, which will affect his physical and mental health. Moreover, my father is old, and I am worried that he will encounter various difficulties in adapting to the new environment, and I will not be able to be with him all the time. My work-life balance problem: If I decide to go to a new city, I may need to find a new job or face a long commute. This will have a great impact on my work and life. I am worried that I will not be able to find a balance between work and taking care of my family. The new work environment may require me to spend more time and energy to adapt, and my mother's condition requires me to invest a lot of time and energy to take care of her, which makes me feel very anxious and I don’t know how to choose. Future uncertainty: Although the new city has more abundant medical resources, we cannot be sure that my mother will get better treatment when she arrives there. There are many uncertainties in the development of the disease. I am worried that even if we make such great efforts, we will not be able to change my mother's condition in the end. This uncertainty about the future makes me feel very confused and helpless, and I don’t know if this decision is correct.",

The whole family was involved, who took care of my grandfather during his hospital stay. Ultimately, my grandfather died in the hospital and I only came for the funeral. The problem I encountered was the distance from my hometown which made it difficult for me to get there, as I didn't have the opportunity to come for a short while and would have had to stay there longer. The second problematic issue was that I didn't really see the point in coming because I would only add to the family's problems related to the need to organize my stay, and it would be better if they took care of my grandfather. Plus, my coming wouldn't help at all, and my relationship with my grandfather was never very strong.",

          "The most difficult decision: whether to quit public office to take care of my father with ALS Time: August 2019 Location: Chongqing home and district government office People involved: me (32 years old, the only child in a single-parent family), my father, my aunt (my father's sister), and my unit leader Background: I have been a civil servant in a district government in Chongqing for 8 years. My job is stable and recognized by my family. At the end of 2018, my father was diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). He was able to move well in the early stage. My aunt took care of him during the day and I accompanied him at night. In July 2019, my aunt had a sudden cerebral infarction and was hospitalized. My father's condition deteriorated rapidly. He could no longer eat or turn over on his own and needed 24-hour special care. Key contradictions: Career level: The unit is preparing for the public announcement of my promotion to section chief (the youngest candidate for section-level cadres in the district), and the leader hinted that \"taking leave at this time may affect the development in the next ten years\"; Family level: My father was a middle school teacher. He sold his old house to support my studies and raised me to adulthood. After the onset of the disease, he repeatedly used his eyes to signal that he \"did not want to drag me down\", but the cost of hospital nursing was as high as 6,000 yuan/month (more than half of my monthly salary), and no reliable candidates could be found. Outbreak event: In the early morning of August 5, 2019, I worked overtime until the early morning and went home. I found that my father fell off the bed and his mouth was broken and bleeding. He was afraid of disturbing my work on the phone, so he struggled alone for half an hour without calling for help. When I carried him back to bed, tears fell from the corners of his eyes and his throat made a vague \"go\" (suspected to ask me to \"go to work\"), and at that moment I realized: career promotion can be repeated, but my father's life is in countdown. Struggle in the decision-making process: The tear between ethics and reality: After being discharged from the hospital, my aunt advised me: \"Your father has been strong all his life. He will be more sad if he knows that he is dragging you down. It is better to hire a professional caregiver, don't resign.\" My colleague said privately: \"You have a high degree and strong ability. It is almost impossible for you to take the civil service exam after resigning. The competition outside the system is so cruel.\" Economic pressure calculation: There is no fixed income after resigning, and all savings (120,000 yuan) need to be used, and the cost of my father's follow-up treatment (such as ventilator, nutrition injection) is unpredictable; Tried to apply for public welfare nursing subsidies, but the process is long and cannot solve the urgent problem in the short term. Self-identity crisis: I used to be proud of my identity as a \"civil servant\". I was worried that I would lose the social label after resigning and become a \"full-time caregiver\" and be talked about by relatives and friends; When I was writing a resignation letter in the study late at night, I stared at the \"Excellent Civil Servant\" award on the wall in a daze, and my hands were shaking so much that the pen tip broke three times. Final decision: Submitted resignation report on August 12, 2019, giving up promotion opportunities. Core actions: Career separation: confessed family difficulties to the leader, and the leader approved \"1 year of unpaid leave\" (special care policy within the system), leaving the possibility of reinstatement in the future; Reconstruction of nursing plan: turned down all social visitors from my father, converted the bedroom into a nursing room, purchased medical beds, suction machines and other equipment, participated in the \"family care training\" organized by the community, and learned skills such as nasogastric feeding, turning over and patting the back, and catheterization; Psychological construction: Tell my father before going to bed every day: \"You raised me up, I will accompany you to grow old, this is my choice, not a sacrifice.\" Although he couldn't respond, I later found that he had hidden my childhood award certificate under his pillow. Career development conflict: Giving up promotion opportunities may lead to loss of career prospects within the system, and there is uncertainty in taking unpaid leave. Economic pressure: No fixed income after resignation, high cost of treatment and care for father, limited savings. Family conflict: Aunt does not support resignation, thinking it will make father feel guilty, and relatives and friends have different opinions. Social recognition anxiety: Worry about losing the social label brought by the civil servant status after resignation and being talked about by others. Self-doubt: Unsure whether resigning to take care of father is the right choice, afraid of regret in the future.",

When the driver asked if I wanted him to use the sirens and I agreed, other vehicles gave way, which relatively shortened both the distance and the travel time. As a result, reaching the hospital was much easier. First of all, approving the use of sirens—even though there was no real emergency—was ethically wrong, and afterward it didn’t feel very positive. Moreover, during that same process, instead of all vehicles yielding, some continued to block the road ahead while others tried to follow right behind the ambulance, which led me to reflect on the flaws in traffic management.",

This involved me, my parents, and my girlfriend, all traveling back and forth between the hospital in my hometown and the city where I work. When making a decision, I faced a conflict between family affection and personal development. My mother needed me, but I was afraid of regret if I gave up the opportunity.

I did not want to go to the hospital. And I went to a second doctor for a second opinion, but he said the same thing. I was upset that I had to go to the hospital and have surgery, I really did not want all this. I thought for a long time, but then everyone persuaded me that I needed to go to the hospital, and the next morning I was already operated on in the morning. And it was terrible, they put a catheter in me incorrectly, everything hurt, when I woke up after the anesthesia, there was a tube in my throat and no one came to me, I wanted it to be pulled out, it was hard for me to breathe, my whole body was shaking like in convulsions, my arms and legs were tied, I was suffocating and shaking, I thought that I was going to die. I also could not open my eyes normally. It was terrible, I would not wish this on anyone. The doctor at the free hospital quickly diagnosed us, which made us all wary. She gave us the diagnosis without an ultrasound. So we went to a private ultrasound specialist and doctor. Well, most likely it's not a problem. I just didn't want to go to a free hospital, since I've been to such places more than once. And this whole hospital atmosphere is depressing, and they don't really help there."

          "The difficult decision I made was to set some distance with one of my husband’s relatives—his sister—because, no matter how friendly I tried to be, she would knock on my door at any hour and come over unannounced. Her constant visits were cutting deeply into the time I had to spend with my husband and daughter. About a month ago, she was coming by almost every day, so I gently but firmly established boundaries without making it obvious. Her nonstop presence was having a negative impact on us, and I needed to protect our family’s private time. My sister‑in‑law wouldn’t take the hint when I sweetly told her, “I’m busy, come another time,” and just stayed in my home. So without making it obvious, any time she showed up I’d quietly take my daughter and step outside—and only returned once she’d left.",

I became homeless practically overnight because his parents didn't like us living together (they knew about it from the beginning, but after 3 months the haunted \"mother-in-law\" started destroying everything, and her adult son, whom she had been abusing his whole life, couldn't do anything because he was \"scared\").

With two children, without confidence in the future, under the pressure of opinions that \"children need a father.\" But in the end, I realized: children need not just a father, but peace, respect and love in the home. And I chose a difficult but honest path - the path to freedom. I faced the following problems: - Pressure from relatives, \"children need any kind of father,\" they kept saying. - Finding a lawyer who really knows all the nuances of dividing property turned out to be almost impossible. Many asked for a lot of money, promising certainty, but at the same time could not give any guarantees. I almost lost a large sum during the division of property - due to the ignorance or negligence of the lawyer. - Defenselessness. My ex-husband was a domestic tyrant. I lived and live in constant fear - for myself, for my children. When I tried to ask for help - I went to the local police officer - they refused to accept my application. They behaved indifferently, as if it was none of their business. Only after I filed a complaint about their inaction via e-mail, they began to react somehow. It was humiliating to feel that even the system, which should do so by law, does not protect you.",

          "My parents are going through a divorce. The three of us live in our family home. My mother has been psychologically abusing us for years – she makes it difficult to use common areas, is passive-aggressive, disrupts the peace in the house, calls us names, and makes noises at night and in the early morning hours so we can't sleep. One of the things she did was spread a pile of books across all the kitchen counters to make it difficult for us to prepare meals. These were old books that were meant to be thrown away (dictionaries, encyclopedias). She was asked to take the ones she wanted and the rest would be thrown away. She decided to leave them all spread out in the kitchen and refused to take them or move them, claiming they belonged there. During her extended absence, I decided to fight for my rights and moved the books to her room. I left a note saying that if the books were returned to the kitchen, they would be thrown away. Since the books were returned, I took them to the recycling bin. Removing these books meant breaking with the previous strategy of \"don't speak, there won't be any arguments\" and, in a sense, declaring open war on my mother (as she understood it). Furthermore, throwing away the books risked police involvement in the \"theft/destruction of property.\" This decision resulted in a full-blown argument, hostility from my mother, and further insults (\"thief\"). It was a transition from existing alongside a violent person to engaging in direct conflict with them. I decided to take this risk to fight for my rights, which I had previously ignored, hoping for relative peace at home. This also resulted in my involvement with the Social Welfare Center (GOPS) and the need to maintain contact with them, which I had to initiate and maintain to fight for my rights.",

In 1979, I decided to go visit my mother, whom I did not know and did not know anything about, especially since my father’s family (my aunt and grandmother) did not accept mentioning her name or talking about her.

          "It's hard to say whether I've made the most difficult decision, because that door is still open - although the question is whether to sue my mother. When I was one, my father died in an accident, but he had life insurance. My mother was paid a large sum (6 figures) which she was obliged to give me on my 18th birthday. In 5 months I'll be 25, and I haven't seen a penny of that money. My mother \"drank away\" some of that money, and with some she bought a small house in the countryside, which she doesn't want to add me to. Even though I had a difficult childhood, largely because of her, I can't bring myself to sue her now, because her health condition is getting worse by the month, and within a few years she may end up in a wheelchair. Mainly, these were moral problems - suing my own mother. Even though she made me a not-so-pleasant childhood and drank away the compensation, she is still a mother, who incidentally has a degree of disability today. In addition, probably financial and legal, being poor, the lawsuit itself and the court costs would be enormous.",

When I went there, the child was using them with a few other friends. I could not bear it. Because I am not a drug user. Then I took the child from there. I thought a lot about what to do about this problem. Because if I tell the police, the child will be taken away and the school's reputation will be damaged.

In fact, it wasn't a decision, but an ultimatum that my mother gave me: she gave me a six-month ban on seeing a girl (a long-distance relationship), and if I broke it, I had to leave home when I came of age. I was young, stupid and blinded by love; I didn't see any other option at the time, so the \"decision\" wasn't hard to make, but it was very difficult emotionally. Maybe not so stupid, because we're still in a happy relationship and live together, but objectively speaking, it was very risky, especially since I was still in school at that point.

Since then, he's accepted the decision very well and thought it was right and fair. Now he's been running after his things, so it was a difficult decision, but it benefited everyone. In this case, the only one who felt bad was me, because it hurt me to make this decision, because a mother's heart knows how it is, for us, children don't grow up and we want to do everything for them throughout their lives, but I thought it was necessary because one day I won't be here anymore so he needs to look for himself, so when that happens he already knows how to act.",

The decision was really difficult because there were events in the past that made me feel uncomfortable with this person and not trust him.

So I decided to erase the past and its memories and start a new page with her husband and to help her convince my father to accept her return to her husband. The memories of the past and some of the quarrels that took place between me and my sister's husband (her ex-husband) always occupied my mind and I did not try to forget them, because his words hurt me during that period. When my sister brought up the subject of her getting back to him with me, the wound reawakened and I replayed the tape of painful memories. The challenge was to try to forget and turn the page and build the relationship again. The second challenge was how to help her convince my parents, as I am a person who has great respect for them and I can never argue with her and I was afraid that they would get angry with me if I brought up the subject with them.",

I've struggled with depression myself for over a decade. In the last ~2 years, I've only slowly started rebuilding my life. And since I still experience depressive *episodes* (not depression per se anymore), my mental stability is still on fragile foundations. 3. Related to the second point - if getting involved causes a return to my private darkness, that will be a problem, because I no longer have the luxury of breaking down: for even the most pragmatic reasons - simply no one in my family will be able to help me financially. 4.

He didn't eat and simply drank as if it were his meal. He also didn't go to work and had to pay for two mortgages on his houses. In the end, he was forcibly sent to the hospital.

Because I had to pay the mortgage, pay off debts, there was simply no other way out. Every day I went to work thinking: \"What if I betray him?\" Maybe this will become a psychological trauma for him, because he could not fall asleep without me, he could not even go to the potty on his own. There were emotional difficulties, sleep and appetite disturbances, adaptation, fights with other children over toys, due to stress and a new environment, the child's immunity weakened and frequent illnesses began.",

Because she couldn't find decent employment, she decided, with the support of her family, to emigrate to the United States through the so-called Hueco, a decision she made without considering me. I should note that our daughter was two and a half years old. A year later, she contacted me to request, again through her family, that our daughter emigrate as well. Given that my financial situation was difficult and my university studies were far behind, I agreed and allowed our daughter to emigrate as well six months later. Separating myself from my daughter has been one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made. The main problem was legal, as my parental rights were suspended. This meant I was giving up raising her, especially the uncertainty of not knowing whether I would ever have contact with her again.",

By then, my two younger brothers were quite grown up. So, my younger brothers and I went to work. Then I felt that my mother was gradually changing me.

Due to various complications, I lived with my grandmother for a long time, so she signed over her apartment (which she had already purchased) to me. My mother stayed with her partner in our previous apartment, but they ended up living with me and my grandmother. After my grandmother's death, I was left alone with them – my mother has a hard time saying \"no\" and adapts very easily to the situations she finds herself in. She stayed with her partner more out of habit than out of any real feelings. Personally, I didn't like him very much and didn't want him in my life – I was an active person in high school, often inviting friends over, participating in exchange programs, and so I also welcomed people from abroad. My mother's partner was – no offense to anyone growing up in the countryside – a complete boor, loud, swearing, and making lewd jokes. I talked to my mother about this many times, and she was the one who said it was my apartment and I could \"kick him out,\" which was quite shocking for me, because it was her relationship. My difficult decision was to talk to her partner, who, of course, wasn't convinced. I was soon to host a Japanese woman on a three-month exchange, so I confronted them both with the choice of either moving out or taking legal action, as the apartment belonged to me. Ultimately, they both moved out, and during that time, my mother broke up with the man and moved back into my apartment. Mainly, the difficulty of talking to someone who doesn't want to talk or doesn't take any messages personally. I knew this would be a difficult conversation with someone, and I was afraid I'd have to resort to \"drastic\" methods, such as threatening to go to court and the police.",

We all lived in a two-room apartment, including my sister and my mother's husband. The relationship with the guy seemed stable and serious.

So the choice was either to help my brother and lose the chance for my dream job or to get a job but to refuse my brother in an important matter. I chose my brother.

I felt very unsafe at that moment. It got to the point where he started threatening her, and I was so stressed and frightened by the whole situation that I ran out of the house in the middle of the night, in the winter, and ran as fast as I could to my grandmother's house, hoping someone would come and help me. I didn't really know what to do—calm him down or talk some sense into him. I guess I thought that if another adult came, it would all go away. I think the decision to run out of the house that day was the hardest I've ever made. '- huge stress - age - I shouldn't have even had to make such a decision at that age, a child doesn't have the cognitive skills to decide on something like that yet - I was very afraid that no one would come to help me - until the very end I didn't know if I had done the right thing and how my intervention would affect what was happening",

But unexpectedly, she developed an allergy and passed away. We were at her house when she passed away, but we were unable to save her. My life, as well as my wife's, became dark. All our plans fell apart. But now I am making up my mind to live without her. Our daughter became our life. We couldn't imagine a life without her. We couldn't save our daughter.

He died suddenly, out of the country, and I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye or even see him because we were fighting, and I hadn't seen him for three years. After his death, the entire family learned how difficult his situation was (multi-million debts), which meant we lost everything we owned (house, apartment, etc.). This happened less than two years ago. By rejecting the inheritance, my family and I are endangering other relatives who had a completely different view of my father. Even though it was his decisions that caused this, I felt ashamed that it would all be revealed. Emotionally, it was a terrible decision, like disowning him; it's hard to think about it without regret, bitterness, and sadness. Legally, everything was also complicated; I'm completely unfamiliar with it, and I also had to support my mother (she's a pensioner and ailing).",

A huge void in my heart and above all, how to explain to the baby that his mommy was going to be gone for a long time and that he wouldn't see her again until she returned.",
          "My hardest decision was when my son was 8 years old and told me he wanted to live with his father, because I put my emotions aside and told him, even though he lived with me and had a schedule for everything and with his father only vacations and weekends without any responsibilities, so I needed to make him know both sides of the story and after 2 months he called me crying because he was going to have a test at school and he couldn't study, there was no one to help, after 3 months he already wanted to leave. I faced judgment from my family and friends, including my mother, who asked me how I could send my only son to live with his father.

          "I haven't made any very complicated decisions in my entire life, but one of them was this: When I left my family for a while to move to another city. For me this decision was very complicated since I had never been so far away from my family, I knew that I was going to miss them a lot and that was what made me doubt what I should choose, in the end I think I made the most correct decision.",
          "The hardest decision I ever made in my life was to close down my shop. But my family—especially my siblings—encouraged me. Our mother had just passed away, and that made it even harder. This was the biggest challenge I’ve ever faced in my life. The challenges and difficulties I faced were that I didn’t have the money to start my project, and I had taken a bank loan. I was afraid I wouldn’t have clients and wouldn’t be able to cover the expenses—especially since the shop was rented",

          "The hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life was to quit a job I didn't like and go freelance. I worked at Kaspi Bank for pennies as a manager, and there was a ton of work. I gave out loans and dreamed of getting out of that bank as quickly as possible. Why was it a hard decision, you ask? Because I have two small children and a wife on maternity leave. I was afraid of being left without income. I faced condemnation from colleagues, misunderstanding from parents, and the fear of being left without money.",

          "The decision was to take on a new, more demanding role at work, which meant more responsibility and a more intense pace. This happened at the beginning in my company, when my supervisor offered me a promotion. My supervisor and my closest family were involved in the decision-making process, with whom I consulted my concerns. On the one hand, I felt that it was a chance to develop, on the other I was afraid of being overloaded and not having time for myself. After a few days of reflection and talking to my loved ones, I decided to take on this challenge. The biggest challenge was the uncertainty of whether I would be able to cope with my new role and the fear of worsening my work-life balance. I also had conflicting opinions from my loved ones, which made it even more difficult to make a decision",
          "The most difficult decision I've ever had to make in my life was to change jobs. It happened a year ago. I was working at a university, but the situation was deteriorating internally. External factors, such as long commute times, were also a factor. At that point, I was internally torn—on the one hand, I felt constantly overwhelmed and exhausted, and on the other, I felt uncertain about the future. The challenges I encountered while making this difficult decision were: uncertainty, a new environment, a job that wasn't related to anything I'd done before, fulfilling a responsible role, and fear of not being fulfilled in my new role.",
          "Changing jobs was the hardest decision I've ever made. Last year, I left the job I'd been working at for four years and moved to a different one. Still, I'm glad I made the switch to a job related to my profession. I had a really hard time at first because it was a habit and I was stepping out of my comfort zone.

          "This was definitely about one of the most important questions of my life: which department I should work in to feel my best. Starting out in the wrong department at the company where I began my internship made me very uneasy, because this was a role I would likely hold for the majority of my career—and I kept wondering if it was really the right fit for me. The most important thing was my own inner uneasiness. Did I want to do this?",

However, since I've been in this job for so many years, I wanted to see myself in a different field. I would like to mention the problem of finding another job as a specific problem. Because I wanted to see myself in another field, finding another job was a real problem.",

It was in the broad sense of the word construction. I always aspired to something bigger. I knew that in this job I was not really developing, I was just standing still, and I am a young guy. I faced a difficult choice whether to stay at work with my brother or leave my brother alone, and I would start looking for a better-paid job in IT, specifically programming. Finally, I made the decision to change my job.

This all happened in the summer of 2022, and things were not going well at the organization. The institution was experiencing management problems, in addition to disputes and problems created by individuals whose only concern was to stop any reform attempt in order to preserve their personal interests at the expense of the public interest.",
          "I work for a foundation that assigns me to a government department. I asked to transfer to another department—a difficult decision because it involves the new location, the people, the environment, and especially how I would react. In my previous department there was constant turmoil and arguments that sometimes involved me. As I was already dealing with personal problems, I needed to remove something that wasn't doing me good, so I requested the transfer. In time, some of the people involved in the turmoil left—they also requested transfers. Once they left, the environment became calmer, and then my transfer letter arrived. I regret it to this day. The pressure and lack of reasoning at the time. I was just feeling down and decided to make a rash decision because it made sense at the time. I wasn't feeling well at the time, and now I regret it.",

But I got a bad offer from one person at that place. So I decided to quit my job. That was the hardest decision I ever made. The new workplace is an unfamiliar, unfamiliar environment. Someone at that workplace made an inappropriate suggestion to me",

In fact, I didn’t face many difficulties because it was within the same company, and you know the challenges of working in the private sector",
          "To be honest, I haven't had to make a difficult decision in the last six months. The hardest thing is to decide to change your life. I've been \"going with the flow\" my whole life, and with the start of the new year I wanted to completely change my life. This is probably the hardest decision not only in the last six months, but in my entire life. It's hard to fix what I've been doing all your life. First, I had to change my thinking, then the environment, all these difficulties that I encountered. There is a lack of support.",

They told me long ago, but it took me almost a year to make my decision, but I finally left my job. I faced pressure from my workplace. Some of my colleagues respected my decision while others did not. But as an individual, I did what I wanted and resigned. I learned that your own happiness is important in this life.",
          "It was 2019. I had been working as a supervisor in a hardware store in Karaganda for three years. The company's regional director offered me a vacant position as a store director in the south of the country. To do this, I had to move to another city with my common-law wife. First of all, the language barrier stopped me. I had already been on a business trip to Kyzylorda twice, and it was difficult to communicate with employees and customers due to my poor knowledge of the Kazakh language. Therefore, one part of me really wanted a promotion, and the other was wary of not being able to cope with the task. After all, if I move to another city, I will not be able to return to Karaganda to the position that I held in this company, since another employee will take my place. Working as a supervisor in Karaganda, I did the work that I had established and put on stream over several years, and it was relatively easy for me. I came to work with pleasure and received a stable income. In general, I was in a comfort zone. It was very difficult for me to make a decision to give up my comfort zone and live in my hometown, where many friends and acquaintances live, as opposed to career growth with a move to another city.",
          "One of the hardest decisions I've made in the last six months was to move to a different department due to a job loss.

As a result, I continue to work at my previous job.",
          "The hardest decision I made was trying to return to the entrepreneurial field and work after a failed first attempt and a severe bout of depression. For a year, I was unable to work, despite the opportunities available. My productivity was nonexistent. The biggest challenge was rebuilding my confidence in my abilities and potential. The difficulties were limited to fear and discipline.",
          "It was a difficult decision to change jobs. I missed my old colleagues. The environment I was used to. Everyone was familiar. They became like close friends. Brotherhood. Respect. Involuntary tears.",
          "Maybe I don't have much experience with life, it may seem silly but the hardest decision I made in my life was leaving a job where I had a lot of autonomy and salary security to start my own company. Fear of not succeeding and being in a complicated financial situation",
          "Leaving a stable job to take on a trusted position. Fear of the unknown, doubts about whether it would work or what to do if it didn’t. The main problem was dealing with anxiety."

On the one hand, she felt that having children was exhausting and painful, and on the other hand, she worried about the pressure and high cost of raising two children. I was also struggling to make the decision, unable to strike a balance, and thus caught in a dilemma. When making the decision, I faced the following challenges: first, the financial pressure was immense. My older child had just started school, and education costs were substantial. Adding a second child to the mix would undoubtedly increase expenses, and my quality of life would undoubtedly decline. Second, my energy was limited. I was already very busy at work, and when I got home, I had to take care of the children and consider the older child's feelings. I simply didn't have the energy to spare.

Ultimately, I couldn't emotionally handle the pregnancy symptoms, and I still feel the mental and physical consequences of that decision. Ethical, religious, and ideological.

I was 18 years old and had a permanent intimate relationship with her and neither of us planned it. I hesitated a lot and had to consult with my father. I asked for his guidance, but in the end she decided not to keep him.

I faced all kinds of difficulties, but finally they allowed us to get married.",
          "I made my difficult decision when I decided to get married. 27 years ago. We had 7 children in our house. I was the second child in the family. I stopped going to school at the age of 16 and went to work. It was at that time that my father decided to get me married. But at that time, there was nothing I could do. I wanted to stay with my family for a while. I wanted to buy a beautiful wedding house. But due to financial difficulties, my family tried to get me married quickly. I was very sad. I even wanted to leave home. But thinking about the reputation of my family, I agreed to get married. My hopes Family's reputation Economic hardship",

          "The decision to divorce after the marriage contract and before the wedding. This happened three years ago, in the city where I live (Rabat). I was primarily concerned with the matter, as was my ex-husband and both families. I did not take enough time to get to know the person proposing during the engagement period, and then the marriage contract was immediately after, but before the wedding we had to arrange some things such as housing, furniture, and general preparations. During this period I began to notice that my husband was irresponsible. I was taking care of everything on my own, looking for a suitable house to rent, searching for furniture. He was noticeably evading responsibility, and the wedding was delayed for these reasons. I began to feel that I should back out before the wedding, because I would never be happy with an irresponsible husband. This is when I began the journey of making a decision, which was difficult by all standards. I was very hesitant before making the decision, given that I was 28 years old, and this was the man I agreed to after numerous previous proposals. But I didn't agree out of personal desire, but rather due to direct and indirect familial and societal pressure. Most of my relatives and friends who were my age had already married and had their first child, and despite my repeated rejections, the family pressure this time was stronger. The refrain \"Give him a chance... How long will you refuse...\" never left my mind during that period, as I had no right to refuse. My family and surroundings were the biggest challenge in making the decision. How, after the number of proposals I had rejected, and after my marriage was finally concluded, would I tell them that he wasn't the right husband? How would they accept the term \"divorcee\" after having heard the term \"spinster\" for a while? No doubt the question dominated their minds: Who will marry you after the divorce? How, after the marriage was announced in my family, academic, professional, and community circles, would I say that the divorce had taken place? What would they say? How would I face their questions and offer their condolences? How would I respond to their advice and guidance as if I were a little girl who had made a mistake? How would I respond every time someone asked me when the wedding would be, even though I had already completed the divorce proceedings? These were the most pressing challenges that worried me during the decision-making process.",

This was 2 months ago and we went to our churches and finally made a decision that we were both happy with. The problem was the price of the wedding, which in the first two churches was much too high, as well as the approach of the priests, which did not help in the decision.",
          "I had made the decision to wear a headscarf. I faced negative views from my parents and relatives, and I faced great difficulties. I was only 18 years old when I made the first difficult decision of my own free will, not giving in to society. I was faced with discrimination and scorn in society.",
          "As someone who had never considered marriage in her life, deciding to marry and getting married may have been the most difficult decision of my life. I didn't make the decision at a specific moment, but rather, it was a process. Witnessing the happiness of people my age or even a few years older in marriage, rather than just anyone else, softened my approach to the idea and shattered my prejudices. So, I can say that I made my decision after careful consideration. At a time when individual life was more intense, and I was accustomed to the comforts of such a life, the idea of transitioning to a collective life presented a significant challenge for me. The biggest challenge was encountering psychological ups and downs and trying to navigate them with a calm mind.",

I became embarrassed to go to bed, to get up, to eat. It was the first time I'd been separated from my family. Getting through this wasn't easy. We lived in the same house for 18 years.

          "The hardest decision of my life was to go to college after high school. It was 6 years ago, I remember looking at the offers of universities I had a chance to get into at home. No one in my family had graduated from college before. My parents didn't encourage me to continue my education, but what motivated me the most was the fact that most of my peers were going to college, and I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it too. I didn't know if I would be able to cope with my studies or if I would have enough financial resources to support myself in a big city. I also didn't know how I would cope on my own, a few dozen kilometers away from home.",
          "It was a difficult decision to give up my dream studies, and constantly force myself to continue looking for a job when I had been unable to find one for almost three months after being fired, no answers, and money was running out, and to fight off suicidal thoughts that were becoming more frequent. It happened at the turn of December and January 2025, I sent about 150 CVs, to which I received no answers, and I slowly began to lose hope, I was threatened with homelessness, so I had to cut costs, and I had to resign from my dream studies... At the very beginning I tried to stay in these studies without paying. I thought I would find a job in a month. Ironically, it didn't work out, so after another month, in order to reduce the debt to the university, I had to resign from part-time studies because I simply couldn't afford them anymore. My dream was to get a master's degree, I was in my last year, unfortunately this dream was ruined/was postponed a lot in time",

It was very difficult because, in addition to my mandatory state service of at least 500,000 lira, I would face numerous financial burdens, including travel expenses for domestic and international congresses, salary disputes, and lengthy legal proceedings. Furthermore, because I was a peace academic, I wouldn't be able to find a position at another state university, and many private universities wouldn't be willing to employ me. I also faced the risk of being unemployed for a long time. Furthermore, my parents were pressuring me not to resign from the state employement.",

          "The hardest decision I ever had to make was to drop out of university. This happened at the very end of my fourth year, about two years ago. I desperately wanted to continue my studies, but writing my master's thesis proved too difficult for me. I had a major blockage, and ultimately, I didn't write a single word, which led to me failing the year and being removed from the student list. I knew that abandoning my studies would be met with fierce resistance from my parents, their disapproval, and their regret. I felt regret because I only had a year left until graduation, and I had put in a lot of work to support myself.",

          "The subject of the decision is not to submit my CV to the colleges and private schools that I want to teach in the future because I am not stable at the present time. Most of it is with myself, because I had already worked on my resume, so I had to convince myself first that I was going to postpone my career again. The only other-related challenge is with my family, because they don't see what I'm doing as a sacrifice.",
          "Entering college. In 2003, I didn't know where to go. A young guy, I didn't know how to live my life, what profession to choose. I was worried that I wouldn't get in. It was difficult to pass the entrance exams. There was a lack of study material. The deadlines for passing the exam were pressing.",

I didn't get accepted on the first list for either the medical or dental program in Krakow, and I had to decide: should I study medicine or dentistry in Zabrze, or should I wait for the next lists from the supplementary admissions process for the medical and dental program in Krakow. I had to choose a field of study without fully knowing what it would be like during and after graduation, or which one I was better suited for. Furthermore, at that time, I was very close to a girl who was going to university in Krakow, and we were already planning to live together, which made me very keen to stay with her in Krakow. Furthermore, there's a big difference between the beauty, number of events, and interesting places in Krakow and Zabrze.",

          "The hardest decision for me was to quit my studies. I was afraid of being judged by others, of my parents' disappointment, and of abandoning something I had worked hard on and shed sweat and tears on. However, my studies were so destructive that I had to do it. This was during the pandemic, when we were locked in our homes and studying from morning till night meant that I was confined to my four walls all day, which led to depression. My parents saw my problems, but I didn't allow myself to think about it, fearing my parents' reaction to me wanting to abandon further education. As I mentioned before, the assessment of others and the reaction of my parents were the biggest difficulties for me. I was afraid of what others would say if I didn't continue my studies, especially since everyone around me was still studying.",
          "I was forced to abandon my university studies. At a very young age, I dropped out of medical school at the Universidad del Norte. My fear of public speaking led me to isolate myself and become obsessed with a single subject, so I stopped attending the rest of my classes. I failed many classes, and it was impossible to make up for the semester. I sought psychiatric help from one of my professors, and he mocked my clinical condition, arguing that it was all my own invention. The university welfare department completely ignored me. My family thought it was all my own invention. They didn't support me during the most difficult time of my youth. I became filled with fear, and I also missed classes. I decided to drop out of college.",
          "This decision concerned starting my second cycle of studies in the same field, but with a different specialization. I thought about this decision for a long time, involving myself, my loved ones, and my friends. It happened two years ago, when I was finishing my part-time bachelor's degree, but I couldn't afford a uniform master's degree at another university. I didn't know whether to check off these studies on principle or drop them and focus on my professional career. Finally, I took up and completed my master's degree. This decision was difficult because I didn't really know what I wanted to do professionally in life. In addition, my private life was very chaotic, unorganized and complicated at the time, so I preferred to bet on a safe solution, to give myself time. At that time, I didn't have the certainty that what I was doing was right. I probably still don't have it today.",

Because my classmates didn’t contribute, I ended up doing everything, which led my teacher to lose confidence in me.

          "Last year, I made a decision about changing my university major. I transferred from ESTÜ Environmental Engineering to Anadolu University's Public Relations and Advertising Department. It was a difficult decision because it was my second year there, including preparatory classes, and dropping out meant I'd lose two years of my life and have to answer to my family. It was also an extra difficult time because I'd also had to deal with the death of a relative and breakup with my girlfriend. After I dropped out, my friends in the department never called me to ask why I'd left or how I was doing. This made me feel worthless. Of course, I initially faced some backlash from my family. Both taking a gap year after the high school and losing two years at this school angered them and diminished their hopes for me. This, in turn, shook my self-confidence and made me question whether I was worthless. Being locked up at home and studying again was challenging. I had also given up on sports to focus more fully. I wasn't a from the literature/humanities fields, and this was the first time I'd taken some classes. I also encountered some humiliating comments from others, like, \"How could you drop out of engineering and pursue such a field?\" Of course, my family eventually became supportive, and I had a friend who was supportive from the start. Thanks to them, the process became a little easier.",

          "The hardest decision I had to make in my life was to give up my studies in a field that didn't satisfy me. I studied law at a renowned university, mainly because my parents and teachers thought it was a good choice - a secure job, prestige, stability. However, as time went by, I felt a growing lack of motivation and inner conflict. It was in the middle of my second year of studies, in Warsaw The main problem was the social and family pressure. I was afraid that if I gave up I would be considered a quitter, and I really didn't want that. Besides, I had huge doubts - \"What if I don't find anything better?\". The lack of a clear plan B didn't help me either - I knew what I didn't want, but I wasn't sure yet what I wanted instead.",
          "I’ve made bigger decisions, but I’ll tell you about the one that comes to mind. In June 2023, I took the YKS exam, and once the results were announced, I had to decide whether to study in another city or stay in my hometown of Eskişehir. I had to make this choice on my own. My family wanted me to remain in Eskişehir, and I wanted to study Public Relations and Advertising. Since Anadolu University in Eskişehir was the best place to pursue that program, I decided to enroll there. When making this decision, it wasn't just because this was the best place to study for the department. It also included problems such as financial problems, psychological problems, and fear of being alone.",
          "This difficult decision was about my education. Last year around this time, I had talked in detail with my father and professors about starting my doctorate right away or after finding a job. I was not in favor of starting right away, but after my professors and my father's guidance, I decided to start. Once I began my PhD, the heavy coursework and my continued preparation for the ALES and language exams would make it impossible to hold any job; I didn’t want to start the program until I had secured my financial independence.",

I found myself caught between my family’s wishes and my own. Because my family was experiencing significant financial hardship during the pandemic, and I feared they would struggle even more if I went to another city without a scholarship or dorm, I chose nursing instead. To this day, I deeply regret not prioritizing my own aspirations and am angry at myself for that. Family pressure, ignoring my own abilities, financial difficulties, lack of personal knowledge, not doing research",

I was asked to register for a master's degree at the time, but I refused due to financial circumstances that were not in my favor. At the end of the 2008/2009 academic year, I obtained a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Arts at Ibn Zohr University. At that time, my supervisor asked me to register in the master's department because she saw my diligence and love of knowledge, but what she did not know was the harsh conditions I lived in that beautiful city. Among the challenges I faced after making this decision were: the lack of job opportunities, as everyone now requires a master’s degree in order to get a good job opportunity.",

My parents and friends from college were involved. It happened a year ago in the city where I study. no amount in the account to pay for the conditional passes for studies, a broken ATM where I wanted to deposit money. Reluctance to study for subjects I did not pass.",
          "This difficult decision concerned the choice of university at which I was to study. My family, especially my mother, was also involved in making this decision. It took place in my family home in 2018. The situation was controversial, because my mother wanted me to study close to home, while I was convinced that the University of Olsztyn would be a better choice for me. I had to decide whether it would be better to focus on the economic aspects, because studying closer to home would mean that I wouldn't have to spend as much money as if I were studying far away from home. In addition, I would be leaving my previous life behind, along with my friends and family. I wouldn't see them as often as I would like.",
          "It was a very difficult one, involving dropping out and changing my studies. Six months ago, I decided I didn't want to continue the path I was on because it was only causing me mental problems. Being supported by my parents, I decided to stop attending classes without telling them and apply for a different program. Uncertainty about telling family, studies will last longer than this one, so future potential financial problems",
          "I had to make a very difficult decision when I decided to drop out of my Master's degree in Finance and Markets. I had realized that this field didn't suit me, and that it wasn't what I really wanted. I felt like I was wasting my time and energy on a path that wasn't right for me. I decided to stop, not because I had failed, but because I no longer wanted to continue. The price I paid for abandoning my studies was far less than the price I would have paid had I continued on a path I didn't love. My acceptance of this decision to drop out of school was not due to any external pressure or compelling circumstances, but rather stemmed from personal conviction. I had no obligations or restrictions preventing me from redirecting my path.",
          "My question was how should I react to my son's complete abandonment of studying and his loss of motivation to achieve anything for himself during the high school entrance exam period.

          "The most difficult decision of my life: Returning to school after six years of dropping out. In 2019, I found myself at a difficult crossroads, facing a fateful decision: Should I continue my career after a long hiatus, or should I return to school despite all the difficulties that might accompany this choice? This decision was very difficult, as I had dropped out of school six years earlier, and it was difficult to break the routine I had built during that period. However, I decided to face my fear and hesitation and revive my academic dream. The subject and details of the decision: The decision revolved around returning to school, which was not easy psychologically or logistically. It required me to commute five times a week between two different cities, causing increasing physical and psychological exhaustion. Those involved: My family: They played a major role, both in support and sometimes in questioning, fearing that I would lose what I had built practically during the years of hiatus. My bosses: It wasn't easy to convince them to reduce my work hours or give me some flexibility in my schedule, and I had to balance my academic and professional commitments. Surrounding circumstances: During that period, there was a lot of pressure, and my anxiety levels increased significantly. I would return home exhausted, finding myself forced to devote myself to classes, giving up a lot of my comfort and personal time. But with all these sacrifices, I felt internally that I was taking the right step towards the future. Conclusion: This decision taught me that the path to great goals is often fraught with obstacles, but perseverance and sincere intention can pave the way, no matter how difficult. Returning to school was one of the most difficult experiences, but it was also one of the most mature and enriching of my life. I faced several real challenges and difficulties when I decided to return to school after six years of dropping out, most notably: Difficulty readjusting to the academic system: After years of absence, it wasn't easy to return to the classroom environment, adhere to deadlines, and handle the pressure of exams and assignments. I sometimes felt like I was falling behind my classmates, which initially created a sense of anxiety and withdrawal. Psychological pressure and anxiety: I was constantly stressed due to trying to balance my studies, work, and personal life. The fear of failure haunted me, especially since I had dropped out of school before, so I had to prove otherwise this time. Physical exhaustion from commuting: Commuting between two cities five times a week was extremely exhausting. I spent long hours in public transportation, which affected my overall health and concentration. Financial pressure: Combining the costs of studying, transportation, and daily living expenses created a significant financial burden. I sometimes had to work part-time, which increased my exhaustion, just to cover these expenses. Surrounding reactions: Some family members or colleagues didn't understand my decision, considering it an \"uncalculated risk.\" I faced criticism and questions like, \"Why now?\" or \"Will I really succeed after this hiatus?\" Giving up rest and personal sacrifices: I gave up a lot of my personal time, hobbies, and even family events. I was working and studying at the same time, so sleep and rest were sometimes luxuries.",

          "While continuing my graduate studies in 2021, with one month left until my thesis deadline, my professor decided to change several sections. I was left with either finishing my thesis or accepting a new provincial offer. I left my studies before completing it and started working. My biggest challenge was how to explain this to my family. I had failed in a process I had continued with their patience and support. The second challenge was that I constantly held expectations of becoming an academic and didn't believe I could do anything else. Consequently, my expectations were dashed. I was afraid my friends and professors would label me a \"failure.\" I was afraid I would lose my job.",
          "Decision on whether or not to quit my university degree. I had completed two years, but it was a department I didn't like, so I left it halfway through, even though it was difficult. My family wanted value for money because it was a private school, so this was a difficult decision.",

I am afraid that I will not find a job, I would like to continue my master's degree studies, but I do not know if after another two years without experience in the profession anyone will want to hire me, I do not know whether to change the industry, on the other hand it may mean that I wasted 3 years on studies that will not improve my life situation in any way. doubting your abilities feeling ashamed and defeated finding a job",

I knew it would involve a 30-minute commute each way and would be very taxing. I was the only one making the decision, but my friends and my mother advised me. The problem was having to choose between a longer workload and further studies, which offered less flexibility. However, university still seemed to be a better fit.",
          "I had to decide whether to continue my studies, which did not satisfy me, or to finish them and get a diploma. Both of these options had their advantages and disadvantages. Lack of advantages on one side, but something drew me to it",

But the head of the family was my grandmother with the attitude from the USSR that higher education is a must. In the end, I took the documents to the university, studied for a year and a half and just stopped going. I did not like anything there. Not the student life, but the education in general. Some teachers said that we were not capable of anything, some told their life stories. And they got money for this. In the end, I do not have a higher education, the desire to do nails was also discouraged. I didn't want it, there was a very strong internal resistance. I fell asleep during lectures. Every morning I persuaded myself to get up and get ready. In the end, it all turned into a huge scandal, I left home for several weeks, didn't go to university. I don't even want to imagine what was going on in my mother's head during that period. Now we have a wonderful relationship in the family, but deep down there is anger that I was not allowed to do what I liked.",
          "While I was at the Ampara Institute of Higher Education to pursue higher education in the field of Agriculture, my mother got admitted to the National School of Education. At that time, I was in the final year of my H.N.D. (HND) course. It was difficult for me to choose between the two. However, I chose the National School of Education in 2022 to become a teacher. Regarding the amount and time I have contributed to the HND course",
          "This happened in my youth and it was connected with entering a higher educational institution. After finishing school I entered the institute, in the fee-paying department, but after studying for 1.5 years, my parents and I (even though I worked part-time) could not pay for my further education. I had to leave my studies. After that, every year, for almost 5 years, I still could not enter a university (on a grant). By the age of 22, no money, no education, no health. After that, complete apathy to everything arose. For quite a long period, I \"dropped out of life\". From a psychological point of view, the difficulty of my decision, probably, was that it cost me a considerable amount of precious time (for many months), before I realized that I needed to continue living and fighting despite the endless series of failures. Annual failures in admission. There were financial problems, there was not enough money even for the manuals and tests for admission. Those years, even people with higher education could not find a job, and if they did, it was poorly paid. Then serious health problems were added to them. It is clear that there was no talk of any personal life.",
          "This decision was about continuing my master's degree a year ago. I got into a course that I thought I would like more or less, but after the first few classes I realized I was wrong. I went through a bachelor's degree in a similar course and felt like I was back to square one. The thought of going through the same thing for two more years really put me off. I wondered if I should give up and find something new next year or grit my teeth and do what had to be done. My mom and close friends helped me make the decision. I felt that these studies were not for me and I should have chosen something else, but I did not consider this before I started. Therefore, if I had dropped out of these studies, I would have been left with nothing. I had no backup plan. In addition, everyone I consulted told me the same thing - I should continue. My mother told me that if I took a break, I would never go back to studies. My friends thought that it couldn't be that bad and that I should give this course another chance. Unfortunately, with each piece of advice they gave me, I felt even worse.",
          "In 2019, I was stuck between studying my dream department in a small and bad city and studying a more ordinary department in a big and developed city.

Although my professors and father supported me during this process, I had to leave school for a while.

When I requested to suspend my studies, the institute imposed several obstacles, and I also faced challenges from the research team I was part of.",

          "This decision concerned whether to go or not to go to a second degree or to work. Although my parents were in favor of me going, it was hard for me to decide what to do. The worst thing was that I had to defend myself at an earlier date to make it to the recruitment. In the end, I went and so far it's not bad. The main problems were parental pressure, indecision and deadlines.",
          "My most difficult decision in life was choosing a university. I attended a mathematics and physics high school, but I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life until almost the very end. That was 2013. I was considering electronics at the Silesian University of Technology, as I had some soldering experience and knew the basics, but I hadn't graduated from a technical school and didn't have the difficult topics of calculating currents or the \"hands-on\" skills. I also considered computer science, but although I'm good at using a PC and it comes naturally to me, I've always been interested in programming, and despite my desire to, I've almost never done it. I also considered following in my sister's footsteps – into civil engineering, but I was afraid I'd fail at drawing because, unlike her, I wasn't talented. In high school, I was friends with a guy who decided he wanted to go and try Automation and Robotics. I thought it sounded similar to computer science and electronics, so I thought it was a good decision. Just in case, I also submitted applications for electronics and, I think, geology, and I took the bus there myself. I'd been to the open days earlier and actually liked that program. It's a shame they encouraged students with a paid program, but they dropped it after my class. It's also a shame they encouraged students with a program related to air traffic control and aviation (there was even a simulator room). That program never opened. I often had classes right next to that room throughout my studies, and I often passed by during the \"window\" and never once saw anyone taking classes there, or anyone coming in except for the cleaning lady (I don't know why). So, the open days were a bit of a letdown, but thanks to them, I'm where I am now – with a degree in robotics programming. I knew that the brightest minds from the province and probably beyond would be applying to study computer science at this university, so I had no chance – especially since, miraculously (with a high school diploma and quite good grades from middle school), I had gotten into a reputable high school in the area (100% pass rate for matriculation exams for many years). So I passed. The second problem was that the one-way commute was about 1.5 hours with transfers, and if the buses weren't scheduled, it could be as long as 2 hours. That's why I was considering a lesser university closer to my hometown. Unfortunately, I was traumatized by the dysfunction I'd encountered in middle school, and I hadn't studied hard enough to escape it in high school and return to university. Therefore, the polytechnic was my only goal, and I decided I'd get over it somehow, because I was skeptical about the dorms – I had a feeling there would be a lot of studying and I wouldn't be working (and I was right), and unfortunately, my parents couldn't afford a dorm.",
          "It was about an academic decision. The people who were involved at the time were me and my friends. They helped me a lot in the process. I was at my university and at home because it was something that took about 3-5 months to process. It happened at the end of last year between September and January. I was going through a bit of a difficult period in my academic life. I needed to decide which subject to focus on in a discipline that was extremely important in the course. I was unsure about which subject to address and whether it would be the most correct one.",
          "I'm generally someone who struggles with making decisions, but I've never had such a difficult time making a decision. Perhaps the hardest one was choosing a university; I remember being incredibly stressed. I spent three days working on it to make the right decision. I also had help from my family. My father, mother, sister, and brothers were all there. Since I was very indecisive about making a decision, looking at universities and choosing them was a general problem for me.",
          "Choosing a university department was one of the hardest decisions I’ve had to make. My mother, a former teacher of mine, and a woman who was a research assistant at the university I was considering were all involved in the process. It was around 2018 or 2019. We went to the university with my preference list, and that research assistant ended up changing most of my rankings. My intention was to get information about the departments, but instead, I was placed based on my exam score and ranking. Rather than choosing a profession that matched my skills and interests, my list was rearranged and submitted entirely according to what fit my score. I was extremely indecisive about whether I should choose based on my ranking or follow my own preference. Meanwhile, everyone kept interfering and offering unsolicited advice as if they knew best.",
          "The decision concerned the choice of studies. It is difficult to choose the exact place, the decision was being made for a long time. In addition to independent considerations, I talked about the options with various friends and family. The decision was being made for several months at the end of high school. I myself wanted to go to psychology or cognitive science, but my family expressed significant reluctance to these fields, kept discouraging me, and expecting me to go to economics or law. Pressure and pushes from various sides, mainly from parents. Expectations that I will go to economics or law, against my will and interests. Stress about making the wrong decision, and dealing with the potential disappointment of other people. Fear that I will not be able to find a job in certain fields, or that I will not cope with them alone.",
          "the decision concerned the choice of the field of study. I was in a mathematics and physics class, and in the last year I decided to study medicine. I did not have advanced biology or chemistry at school, I had to learn everything myself in less than a year. catching up on the material cost me a lot of work and a lot of stress many people advised me against this choice. I had no support from friends or family. I also had to prepare for the final exams in other subjects, I didn't know how to plan this time",
          "The hardest decision I've ever made was choosing what to study. I took the ICFES Saber tests, and my score wasn't what I expected, and I became quite depressed. I longed for a good score to have the freedom to choose, but now I was limited only by that score. Now, in my city, there's only one public university, so I had to settle for the majors offered there. I spent an entire day on the computer looking at the curriculum for each major, afraid of making a mistake in the future and not liking the major when I graduated, wasting my time for nothing. The problem was that I hadn't stopped to think about what I really wanted to do, in the future, and in the world of work. I'd been under that pressure since the beginning of my last year of school, and now I had to face it once and for all. I was also afraid of disappointing everyone, of choosing a career that had no job prospects.",
          "The most difficult decision of my life was choosing a field of study. My parents were also involved, and it was made at home five years ago. Considering the pros and cons of each field of study and possible future career paths after each.",
          "My decision to change my university department was the hardest decision I ever made. It was a decision that completely changed the direction of my life. I would have changed all my plans, the entire course of my life. My family and I thought this decision would be for the better. I didn't actually encounter any problems, but I was worried about how my new routine would be afterwards.",
          "Choosing which subjects to enroll in at the University in the current semester to advance, was a personal decision The problems I encountered were that some subjects did not fit into my schedule, they overlapped or I could not see it, because I had not seen a previous subject that opens that one.",
          "The hardest decision I made was choosing a field of study five years ago. My entire immediate family was involved in my decision, encouraging me to choose psychology. This was a year after I finished my high school final exams, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. I felt a lot of pressure from my family, especially my grandparents, who constantly asked me what I'd chosen. I wasn't sure if choosing this field would guarantee me a good salary and job satisfaction in the future. I worried that after a few semesters, I'd want to change my major, and all my time would be wasted. In high school, I had a difficult family situation and struggled with health issues, which prevented me from thinking much about the future.",
          "Choosing a high school was a difficult decision for me. I had been accepted to Science High School, Military High School and Police College and was having a hard time making a choice. My father left the choice to me and forced me to make my own decision. Being separated from my family and choosing a career early made my decision difficult. I lived in a small town and my circle of friends was limited.",
          "It was a decision about the course of study I am starting this year. My parents were involved, as were friends and family. The decision dragged on for many weeks, but after a long and exhaustive research I managed to choose. The decision was made a week ago. Choice paralysis - too many different study fields that interest me, types of studies my friends chose, earnings, travel time, diplomas",
          "Choosing the right school Pressure from third parties and the enormous stress of making a decision meant that I was unable to make up my mind.",
          "Getting into one of the most demanding technical universities in Poland. Stress related to finances, I didn't know if I would be able to pay the tuition fees at the university, I didn't know if I would manage, if it was even worth it. My parents also warned me to think about what I was doing, so that I wouldn't say later that it was hard. I felt pressure on myself, but I wanted to go there to get a good education.",
          "I am Temir Akerke the most difficult time for me was when I graduated from the eleventh grade, when I scored very low on the UNT, and when my parents chose my profession, not me. There was a time when I studied in Zhetysai because I was not allowed to go to the city.",
          "During my university entrance exam (YKS) process, I had to make a difficult decision about which department to choose. It was certainly a challenging decision — I was torn between professions like classroom teaching, psychological counseling and guidance (PDR), and psychology. However, with the help and advice of my family and teachers, I chose the classroom teaching department. Considering that I’ve just completed my third year, this decision took place around June 2022. Everyone told me their opinions, saying they thought about my well-being, but there were times when my opinion was ignored. As a result, I can say that I am in a department where I am happy now, having solved this problem.",
          "I think the hardest decision in my life was choosing a college. The only person involved at that moment was me and I had to choose whether I wanted to go to college in my city or another one. Searching for potential apartments in another city.",
          "I was accepted into two different federal universities — Pharmacy at UFSC and Radiology at IFSC — and I was genuinely interested in both, which made the decision really difficult. I talked it over with my parents and with my aunt, who has a degree in Radiology. When I found out I had passed, I was at home — it was early in the year. Everything felt a bit confusing because, at the same time, I was deeply saddened by the passing of my cat. I finished high school later than usual, so I was afraid of choosing a college program I wouldn’t connect with — and ending up wasting even more time in my life.",
          "It was about the general election. It took place among the candidates who participated in the election. It took place at the polling place and at the time of voting. It was difficult to determine the best candidate for the future of the country. Indecision.",
          "I moved from formal (in-person) education to open education (distance education) in my education life I feared",
          "It was about transferring to open high school, and my mother, father, and sister were involved. I had anxiety and the result was not good.",
          "Perhaps the most memorable, difficult decision I've ever had to make was about four years ago, when I had to decide between continuing my unsatisfactory studies and potentially pursuing a new major. My parents and I were, of course, involved. There was a lack of understanding from my parents, who weren't familiar with the realities of current universities and the job market, and pressure from them. Unfortunately, I didn't know which direction I should take, so my decision-making was also very shaky.",
          "I had to choose which high school I wanted to go to. I had a lot of different factors to analyze; do I want to go somewhere closer, or where my friends are, or where the level is good, etc.",
          "It might have been choosing my university. My mother and my brother were with me, and we were making a preference list in the garden of my brother’s dormitory. The indecision and uncertainty were very hard for me. Not being able to make a decision, having a voice in every head. Not having someone to guide me that I can fully trust, and feeling insecure.",
          "When the results of the YKS exam were released, I had to decide which universities to put on my preference list. My family and I began researching together, but I just couldn’t make up my mind. In the end, I put the list together with the help of an acquaintance. My ranking was not enough for the department that was right for me, or my family did not want the departments that I wanted.",
          "The most difficult decision of my life was choosing a university. After graduating from high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Influenced by my parents and the example of my friends, I applied to engineering studies, but I was completely unconvinced. This decision was incredibly difficult because it would impact my entire future. Lack of own opinion, pressure from parents.",
          "My first difficult decision came right after middle school, when I was about to start high school in 1999. I had completed all my education in Van, in eastern Turkey, where the schooling standards were almost non-existent at the time. In practice, we would bring teachers gifts like cheese or yogurt in exchange for good report cards. I found it extremely hard to decide on moving up to high school—especially since my family chose for me to attend in the west (in Amasya). Aware that I’d essentially received little to no real academic preparation before middle school and that my true schooling would only begin at high school, I went through a very challenging time. Family pressure, lack of self-confidence, peer pressure",
          "The decision of whether or not to continue with my university career was solely my own, and it was made at a turning point in my life. The biggest problem was the anxiety that comes from not knowing anything about the future, not knowing what my life will be like, and the fear that something like that produces.",
          "I was in the transition period from middle school to high school. I was enrolled in a boys' high school and I was torn between whether to go or not, and because of this, one year of my life was wasted. I spent 1 year at home, so 1 year was wasted.",
          "It was about choosing a university. I made my choice three years ago, and my family, teachers, and community were all involved in the process. Since I took a gap year after graduation, it was much more difficult for me to get into the university and make my choice in the second year because I had significant anxiety about the future. I didn't know which department I wanted to study, which city I wanted to go to or whether I would stay in my own city or not, I was very nervous.",
          "The hardest decision I've ever made was leaving Yıldız Technical University's Electrical Engineering Department to transfer to Ege University's Industrial Engineering Department. But I'm now very happy with my decision. I had the support of my father when making this decision. When I made this difficult decision, I needed to transfer my registration on the same day. I had to fly from Istanbul to Izmir. That day, the plane was late, and I had to spend a lot of money on a taxi to get my registration in time.",
          "My hardest decision was the one I made during university application period. I was 18 years old, and my parents wanted me to study medicine. But I wanted to study my dream field. So, I ended up studying genetics. My biggest problems were the anxiety of unemployment, the difficulty of the field, and the fact that I fundamentally didn't want to study. However, my family wasn't supportive."
