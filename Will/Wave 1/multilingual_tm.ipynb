After junior high school, we have to face the lottery decision. If you are unlucky, you will be drawn to a not-so-good middle school, which will be very difficult in the future. And there is also a very good primary school near us, which has a junior high school department and the teaching quality is also very good. My husband and I have different opinions.

We struggled for more than two months at the time, and finally chose my husband's method. I faced many problems when making this difficult decision.

I didn't know anything. I remember very clearly that when the college entrance examination results came out, we had to start filling out the application form immediately. My father, my mother, my sister, and I were all there, sitting on the sofa in my living room, looking at my average score. Everyone was confused. I was the first college student in my family, and the highest education level of the others was only junior high school, and some even had never been to school.

Because work stress and conflicts with my superiors made me feel like I was incompetent. In the years that passed, I re-registered for the driver's license. The difficult thing for me was the decision to re-register.

The decision was made in March during a semester project at university due to division of labor and communication problems within the group. There were three other people on my team, and we had all worked with them on different projects before. However, this time, everyone's expectations, contributions, and communication styles were so different that not only did productivity drop, but I also started to experience serious stress while fulfilling my own responsibilities. At the end of all this, I decided to withdraw from the team in order to protect my own mental health and not to harm the progress of the project. It was not an easy decision to make, because the bonds between us and our past successes made my decision even harder.",
          "I am a firm believer of concept of Karma, Prarabhdha and Iswara's Grace.I also seek guidance from gurus, closely knitted people and also seek for astrological advice especially in crucial aspects and decision making.Most of the times, the guidance has helped me to align my efforts and freewill to work towards favorable and desired outcomes. However, I also have realized that the guidance sought from people despite of good intentions and correct knowledge can have huge limitations when those factors come to face against of Prabal Prarabhdha .This is where one's deed done in the past sometimes draw the outcomes which are completely opposite to what one has desired while putting efforts thinking that one could fathom and decode the unknown aspects making it knowable. Given the above context, in recent past in a matter pertaining to my personal front I had to take a tough call of accepting the situation where things did not work out.This was despite of doing sadhana, seeking astrological advice from learned people.The cues and situations which were getting unfolded seemingly turning out to be favourable took a different direction.

          "1. Scene review: Winter of 2018, ICU ward of Municipal Hospital Characters: I (32 years old, female): I was abused by my father since I was a child. My mother died in a car accident due to my father's alcoholism at the age of 16. Since then, I have severed ties with my father and lived alone in another place. Father (58 years old): He was in the late stage of liver cirrhosis. When he was sober, he asked relatives to convey his \"want to apologize\" many times, but he never said it in person. Aunt: My father's sister, who has taken care of me since I was a child, insisted that \"blood is thicker than water\", and hoped that I would see my father for the last time. Attending doctor: Informed that \"there are at most two weeks left\", and suggested that the family be mentally prepared. Key events: When I received the call from my aunt, I was at the airport preparing to fly abroad on a business trip. A photo of my father lying on the hospital bed popped up on the screen of my mobile phone - he was so thin that he was unrecognizable, with a nasogastric tube extending from his nasal cavity to his chest, and his right wrist still had the scars from my scratches when I was abused many years ago. My aunt cried on the phone and said, \"He wakes up at three in the morning every day, staring at the ceiling and reading your name.\" I sat on a bench in the airport lobby for three hours, with two tickets in front of me: one was a business class flight to Paris that night, and the project was about to be signed, which was a key opportunity for my career advancement; the other was an economy class flight back to my hometown half an hour later, and after landing, I had to take a two-hour bus to get to the hospital. Suddenly, a screenshot of the news on the day of my mother's car accident popped up on my phone (this is a memory I dare not touch for many years): my father drove drunk and hit the guardrail, and my mother died on the spot to protect me, the co-pilot, but he was only slightly injured. In court, he screamed at the judge, \"Anyway, my daughter is not my own,\" and this sentence was like a knife engraved into my heart, becoming a wound that will never heal. 1. The stranglehold of emotion and reason Reason told me: He used a belt to beat my textbooks, smashed my glasses the night before my high school entrance exam, and even drunkenly said \"I'll save you trouble if you die\" at my mother's funeral. Such a person is not worthy of forgiveness. But my emotions are wavering: my aunt sent me a video - my father trembled and wrote the three words \"I'm sorry\" with his left hand, and the ink was blurred by tears. It was the first time he wrote an apology letter, and I waited for these three words for 16 years. 2. The countdown of time The attending doctor said: \"He is now sometimes awake and sometimes unconscious, and he may not be able to wait for you to come back tomorrow.\" The project leader in Paris sent a message: \"If you don't fly tonight, the partner may turn to a competitor. This is the opportunity you have been waiting for three years.\" The airport broadcast broadcasts flight information every ten minutes. I watched the second hand on the clock jump, and every beat was like a blow to my heart. 3. The collapse of self-identity If you choose to forgive: does it mean betraying your mother's death? Should I deny all the sufferings I had endured in the past to escape from him? My friend said, \"You forgive him, but you are only satisfying his desire for atonement, not really letting yourself go.\" If I choose to leave: Will I be devoured by guilt for the rest of my life? When I become a mother, can I face my child asking \"What kind of person is grandpa?\" 3. The ultimate torture that cannot be avoided In the airport bathroom, I stared at my pale self in the mirror and suddenly remembered what I wrote in my diary when I was 17 years old: \"I want to be the exact opposite of him and never be controlled by hatred.\" The choice at this moment is no longer a simple \"go or not\", but: What kind of person do I want to be? A victim defined by pain, or a survivor who can transcend the harm? Is forgiveness equal to forgetting? If forgiveness is to free oneself, rather than to glorify his faults, is it justified? What is the weight of blood relationship? Does the biological father-daughter relationship necessarily come with emotional obligations? 4. Final Choice and Aftermath I tore up my ticket to Paris, sent a note of \"I'm sorry\" to the project team at the boarding gate, and then walked to the security checkpoint for the flight from my hometown. When I arrived at the hospital, my father had fallen into a coma. I held his needle-streaked hand and remembered the last unsent text message from my mother before she died: \"Nannan, Dad said today that he would quit drinking. He said that when you get into college, he would take you to Beijing to see the Great Wall.\" At five in the morning, the monitor beeped for a long time. A tear slid down the corner of his eye, but I didn't say \"I forgive you\" after all. Later, when I sorted out his belongings, I found a tattered account book under his pillow. The page in 1998 read: \"My daughter wants to learn painting, save money to buy paint - 32 yuan.\" That year, his monthly salary was only 400 yuan, and I finally gave up the art exam because of his opposition. 5. What this decision taught me There is no perfect choice: I lost the opportunity for promotion, but received a call from a strange woman at his funeral - she is my biological mother, who left home because of my father's alcoholism. In order to keep me, my father lied that I was \"adopted\". Pain will be redefined, but it will not disappear: I still see him raising the belt in nightmares, but the difference is that I no longer need to prove that I live a better life by \"hating him\". The essence of reconciliation is self-salvation: not for him, but for the 16-year-old self who is trapped to truly walk into the sun.",

I compiled the most promising areas of the city where I planned to buy an apartment, then made a list of reliable developers with high-quality construction. Every day I studied the offers of a certain developer from my list. I went and called banks to find out the most favorable conditions for myself. Having decided on an apartment, I contacted the developer's manager and then found out that they only issue loans for apartments on the first and last floors. Disappointed, I wanted to give up on this idea, but then decided to look for an apartment on the secondary market. I found the apartment exactly what I wanted - the area, the developer, the number of floors, the square footage satisfied everything. The seller turned out to be a nice woman psychologist, we immediately agreed on the price. She agreed to wait a little with the loan. I arranged a vacation, bought tickets to the city where I bought the apartment. And then a couple of days before the flight I was overcome with fear - will I be able to pay off the loan every month, what if something happens to me, then who will cover my debt if I lose my job... but at the same time I have 20 years left until retirement, and the pension benefit is very small and who will provide for me then, this question also did not leave me alone. I would not want to eat only bread and drink boiling water at 60 years old or sit on the neck of my nephews... The worries were strong, I did not sleep and did not eat. But I decided that it was worth the risk. In the end, I flew, saw the apartment, met the seller and applied for a loan. Everything went well overall, even better than I expected. The apartment was freshly renovated, with furniture. Now I have been paying the mortgage for almost half a year and, it seems, there are no financial problems. The problems were that I was planning to buy real estate in another city, I couldn’t see the apartment in person, I also encountered the fact that the same bank provided different advice, despite the age of technology I couldn’t fully understand the terms of the loan, in addition, there were problems with arranging a vacation, they didn’t want to give me a vacation and the most important thing was the fear of losing my financial balance.",

It was during the college graduation season, and the location was in the school dormitory. The people involved were me and my parents. At that time, a company in my hometown offered me an olive branch, and the job was easy and the salary was stable. At the same time, I received an interview invitation from a well-known company in a first-tier city, which had great development space but fierce competition. My parents hoped that I would stay in my hometown, be with them all the time, and live a stable life. But I longed to go to a big city to pursue greater development. This put me in a dilemma, and I weighed the pros and cons repeatedly and struggled for a long time. When making this decision, I encountered the following specific problems: On the one hand, I was worried that it would be difficult to gain a foothold in first-tier cities, facing high living costs and high-intensity work pressure. If I failed, I would not only waste my time but also miss job opportunities in my hometown. On the other hand, although staying in my hometown was stable, I was unwilling to give up my dream and was afraid that I would regret not fighting for it in the future.

It took almost a whole year to even consider retaking the test. My driver's license was set to expire a few months later by the time I had to make the difficult decision to retake my test. My family was there to encourage me to retake it and even offered to pay a portion of the lessons + rental. I was basically still against the idea but I ended up going through with it but that was due to my guilt of not passing the first time around. During the entire time from lessons to test time, I was depressed because I kept telling myself I wasn't good enough and that I would be just wasting money again. Specific issues included mental fatigue and a voice in the back of my head telling my that I was going to fail and I would be down $2000+ in total (including money my family pitched in). It was just myself telling myself that everything was going to go wrong and that it was the end of the world. I did have depressing thoughts too during this process/experience.

The people involved myself, my wife, and to a lesser extent, our two children (ages 8 and 4). I also consulted a trusted mentor and my current supervisor. At the time, we were feeling relatively stable in our current situation, but the opportunity promised a significant salary increase and more upward mobility long-term. Emotional Weight: Uprooting our kids during the school year and leaving close friends behind was emotionally taxing.  Financial Uncertainty: While the salary increase was appealing, the cost of living in the new city was higher, and there were hidden relocation costs.   Career Risk: There was uncertainty about the new company's culture and stability, which made it hard to assess long-term fit.  Timing: The offer had a short deadline and I had only a few days to decide.  In the end, we decided not to accept the offer, choosing family stability over financial gain.

I didn’t agree before because they were all new shoes that I had never worn and I couldn’t bear to throw them away. I definitely didn’t want to throw them away after spending money to buy them and never wearing them. Later, he said, \"Can you wear so many shoes? They just take up space at home. Go and clear out the shoes, the ones you don’t like and the ones that don’t look good now. Next time you go back to your hometown, bring them back to your relatives. These shoes can be said to be useful, and it’s better than throwing them away.\" So I did it later. I was reluctant to do so when I made this decision, but then I thought about it and realized my husband was right. I didn’t wear them and they took up space at home. The shoes peeled and came undone after being kept for a long time, so I had to throw them away. It was a waste of money and I never wore them.

          "The most difficult decision was whether to take my mother, who suffers from a serious chronic disease, away from her familiar living environment and go to a strange city with more abundant medical resources for long-term treatment. The people involved at that time were me, my father, my mother, and my mother's attending physician. It was a winter day about three years ago, and the location was at my mother's home. After my mother was diagnosed with a serious chronic disease, after a period of treatment in a local hospital, although her condition was under control, she could not get a more effective cure. After a detailed communication with me, the attending physician suggested that we consider going to a city with a higher level of medical care, where there are more advanced medical equipment and richer treatment experience, which may bring a new turn for my mother's condition. However, my mother has a deep affection for the home where she has lived all her life, and she is reluctant to leave her familiar neighbors, friends and daily rhythm of life; my father is worried about my mother's condition on the one hand, and on the other hand, he is concerned about the inconveniences of life in a new city; and I, as a child, hope to get better treatment opportunities for my mother, but I also know that this decision will bring great changes to the whole family. The mother's emotions and wishes: My mother's attachment to her hometown is very strong. She is afraid that she will feel lonely and helpless in the new city. She is worried that life will become boring without her familiar social circle. She feels that in the current environment, at least there are old neighbors who can occasionally chat and participate in some community activities together. Moreover, she is worried that her physical condition cannot adapt to the changes in the new environment. This makes me very entangled. I want to respect her wishes, but I don't want to miss the treatment opportunities that may help her condition. The problem of family financial burden: Living in a new city means bearing higher living costs, including rent, medical expenses, daily expenses, etc. Although the new city has abundant medical resources, the corresponding treatment costs may also be higher. Although our family's original financial situation can maintain basic living, I still feel great pressure when facing such an additional expense. I need to carefully weigh the family's financial affordability to ensure that the family will not fall into financial difficulties because of this decision. The problem of father's life adaptation: My father has become accustomed to the current lifestyle. He has his own social circle and daily activities. If the whole family moves to a new city, he needs to re-establish his own life circle, which is also a big challenge for him. I am worried that my father will feel uncomfortable with the change in living environment, which will affect his physical and mental health. Moreover, my father is old, and I am worried that he will encounter various difficulties in adapting to the new environment, and I will not be able to be with him all the time. My work-life balance problem: If I decide to go to a new city, I may need to find a new job or face a long commute. This will have a great impact on my work and life. I am worried that I will not be able to find a balance between work and taking care of my family. The new work environment may require me to spend more time and energy to adapt, and my mother's condition requires me to invest a lot of time and energy to take care of her, which makes me feel very anxious and I don’t know how to choose. Future uncertainty: Although the new city has more abundant medical resources, we cannot be sure that my mother will get better treatment when she arrives there. There are many uncertainties in the development of the disease. I am worried that even if we make such great efforts, we will not be able to change my mother's condition in the end. This uncertainty about the future makes me feel very confused and helpless, and I don’t know if this decision is correct.",

All of my family members knew about our relationship and thought we would get married when he came to Türkiye. My mother, father, brother, uncle and many others... I think I kept quiet and continued the relationship because I couldn't handle being cheated on and explaining the situation to many people if he didn't come back. He came to Türkiye and things got really bad for me. I feel very lucky that he's not in my life now, but the situation I was in at the time, being very young, the pressure I felt... Unfortunately, it made me make a decision that I later regretted. Disappointment and fear of telling my family and friends about the situation. Ignoring my own needs.

          "The difficult decision I made was whether to transfer my child to another primary school. The primary school my child is currently attending has poor teaching staff, a bad learning atmosphere in the class, and my child's grades are not ideal. The last time I chatted with my neighbors in the community, I learned that there is a key primary school in the neighboring area with vacant places. This school has good teaching quality and rich learning resources. However, there are many problems with transferring. The new school is far from home, and it takes a lot of time to pick up and drop off every day. I am worried that my child will have psychological pressure when he leaves his familiar teachers and classmates. After repeated discussions with my family, everyone disagreed, which put me in a difficult decision. Problems encountered: 1 It takes 40 minutes to drive from home to the school. My wife and I are busy at work, so picking up and dropping off the children has become a big problem. The elderly in the family are old, and there are safety hazards in traveling. The school bus does not match our commuting time, so it is troublesome to connect. 2 The child is introverted and has just made some good friends. Transferring to a new school means re-adapting to the class environment, the teaching style of the new teacher, etc., which will affect the child's mental health. 3 The teaching progress of the new school may be different from that of the original school, and I am afraid that I can't keep up with the progress of the new school. If I stay in the original school, I am worried that the poor learning environment will continue to affect the child's academic development.",

          "The most difficult decision I have made in the past six months was whether to accept an overseas job opportunity. This decision involved me, my family, and a potential new employer. It happened at the beginning of this year. Through a former colleague, I learned about a job vacancy in an overseas branch of an international company. This position was highly consistent with my career plan and provided a broader development space and more competitive salary. Specifically, this decision began to be seriously considered on a weekend in February this year. At that time, I received a detailed job description and interview invitation from the new employer. In the following weeks, I went through multiple rounds of interviews and had in-depth exchanges with team members and superiors. At the same time, I also began to discuss this opportunity with my family, including possible life changes, children's education issues, and adjustments to family relationships. Family factors: Spouse's work and adaptation: My spouse currently has a stable job in China and is very satisfied with the current living environment. If she accepts overseas work, she may need to give up her current job and find career opportunities in a completely new environment, which is a huge challenge for her. Children's education: Our child is in elementary school, and transferring to an unfamiliar education system may have an impact on his learning and growth. We need to consider how to ensure that he can adapt smoothly to the new environment and continue to maintain a good learning state. Maintaining family relationships: Leaving China means that we will be separated from our relatives and friends, which may have a certain impact on family relationships. We need to consider how to keep in touch with our family and how to support them at important moments. Career development: Uncertainty in career prospects: Although overseas work provides a broader development space, I am also worried about whether I can adapt to the new work environment and cultural background, and whether I can play my strengths in the new team. Career positioning after returning to China: If I accept overseas work, I may face the problem of career positioning when I return to China a few years later. I need to consider how to reposition myself in the domestic market and how to use overseas work experience to increase competitiveness in my career development. Life adaptation: Cultural differences: Working overseas means that I will live in a country with a completely different cultural background, which may bring a series of life adaptation problems, including language barriers, eating habits, social habits, etc. Safety and health: I also need to consider the safety and medical conditions of the destination to ensure that my life and my family's life overseas can be fully protected.",

At that time, I still felt that my poster style would be better than the one they discussed, but it was still different from their ideas. After comprehensive discussion, we decided to add some of my poster style to the new plan. We had a disagreement during the discussion and almost had a quarrel with the team.

          "The most difficult decision I’ve had to make in the past six months involved choosing between continuing a stable academic position or transitioning into a new, more uncertain role in the field of artificial intelligence and data training. As someone with a long-standing career in academia, lecturing in mathematics and physics at institutions, my life had been built around education, research, and mentoring students. However, over time, I developed a growing interest in the evolving intersection of education and AI.  This decision came to a head around February 2025, when I received an offer to work as an Advanced AI Data Trainer. This new role promised exciting challenges chance to directly contribute to how AI systems learn and understand complex human concepts, including mathematics and linguistics. However, it also meant stepping away from my established position, my students, and the sense of security and identity I had cultivated as an educator.  Key people involved included my department head at the university, a former colleague who had transitioned into tech and encouraged me to apply, and my immediate family, whose support was crucial. These conversations mostly took place in person and over extended phone calls, often during quiet evenings at home, where I had the space to think deeply. One of the main challenges I faced in making this decision was grappling with the potential loss of professional identity and fulfillment, as leaving academia meant stepping away from a role I had passionately embraced for over a decade. There was also the issue of stability versus risk; the academic path offered security and predictability, while the new AI role, although exciting, came with uncertainty and a steep learning curve. Emotional attachment to my students and colleagues made the decision even harder, as I felt a strong sense of responsibility and connection to those I had mentored and collaborated with. Additionally, I struggled with self-doubt, questioning whether I could successfully transition into a fast-paced tech environment with different expectations and skillsets. Lastly, I had to consider the impact on my family, since the new role involved occasional travel and changes to our daily routine, requiring their support and adjustment as well.",

          "The most difficult decision was choosing a subject for the 5th and 6th semester of studies.

On the one hand, I considered a more practical subject that would provide specific skills sought on the job market, on the other hand, I was tempted by a more theoretical option, but in line with my interests. The problem was the limited time to make a decision and the uncertainty whether I was making the right choice for my future career. Choosing between AI and software engineering was extremely difficult for me due to the conflict between my personal passion and my career prospects. The decision was complicated by conflicting opinions from lecturers, family and seniors, and the lack of reliable data on future employment opportunities. The time pressure was enormous as I had to decide within a few days while also preparing for final exams. I was not sure about my math skills required for the AI track, which also had a limited number of spots. The choice also affected my relationships with friends as most of them chose software engineering, which meant fewer joint projects in the future.",

I felt sick and realized the principal was friends with this family and had talked to them-but nothing had happened. I went back to my classroom and decided I had to call Social Services. It was a really tough decision to call, but they felt it was enough to start an investigation. My principal called me to the office the next day and was furious with me.

          "This difficult decision was about whether to accept a job promotion opportunity in another city. It was in June last year, and the location was in my living room. The people involved were me, my parents, and my partner. I have been working hard in a local company, and I have the opportunity to be promoted to a foreign headquarters, which will greatly increase my salary and career development space. But if I go to another city, it means being separated from my parents and partner. My parents are old and need someone to take care of them, and my partner and I have a good relationship and don’t want to live in different places. We sat in the living room and had a long discussion. My parents expressed their support for me to pursue my career and that they can take care of themselves. Although my partner understood that this was a rare opportunity, he also expressed his reluctance and worried that living in a different place would affect our relationship. I was very entangled and didn’t know how to choose. Family and emotional aspects: Worry about not being with parents for a long time and not being able to fulfill filial piety in time. If parents have physical problems, they will not be able to take care of them in time. Being in different places with your partner may affect your relationship due to distance and inconvenience in communication, and the future direction of the relationship is full of uncertainty. - Life adaptation: The climate, diet, and pace of life in the city you are going to are different from those in your local area. You are worried that you will find it difficult to adapt to the new environment and your quality of life will decline. - Career development risks: Although there are opportunities for promotion, you need to re-establish personal connections in the new environment, adapt to the new work team and corporate culture, and you are not sure whether you can carry out your work smoothly. If things don’t go well, you may also lose your existing local work foundation.",

          "Regarding my path to graduate school, whether to take the recommendation or prepare for the exam, at the beginning of this year (the second semester of my junior year), the school changed the recommendation policy, so that the two national-level awards I had won before no longer added points (according to the previous policy, my chances of recommendation were very high, so I did not prepare for the relevant review for the graduate school entrance examination). According to the new recommendation policy, I was on the edge. At that time, I was working on a project with my teacher and preparing for another competition. If I decided to take the graduate school entrance examination, then the preparation for this project and the competition would have to be stopped, and the previous efforts would be in vain; if I decided to take the recommendation, there would also be a lot of uncertainty, because the school did not announce the number of recommended places, and I didn’t know whether other students had extra points for scientific research or competitions, and I didn’t know whether I could get a place. Both choices have their disadvantages. If I choose to take the postgraduate entrance examination, it seems a little late because I had no preparation before, and I have to give up the project and the competition, which I am reluctant to do; if I choose to be admitted to graduate school, there will be too much uncertainty, and the longer I delay the decision, the more serious it will become.

I couldn't ascribe it to any particular reason either. I had been away from home since 2015 (from the time i began college) and at that time was working in a city away from my mom and sister, living with a school friend. Probably the thought of leaving them and going to a far off place with no certainty of returning in the near future was one of the driving factors. I primarily took the call by myself with the help of my flatmate. The decision to give up on the master's program came with a lot of self-doubt, fear of failure and with no clarity of what lay ahead.

Going to the nearby town was a good exercise; we were isolated from the politics, noise, and pollution, but because of our age, we began to face health problems that forced us to travel back and forth to Bogotá. Thinking about this, we decided it was best to return to the capital to maintain our health (at least until the guerrillas finish ruining it).

Fortunately I was able to find another carer to take the load of me but this was an issue when I made my decision. Another specific issue was making my home safe for m brother who often breaks things and is dangerous around sharp objects. I had to buy new furniture and remove wooden tables replacing them with plastic. I also had to completley renovate my spare room costing quite a lot of money.",

And since my job required me to be a salesperson, I faced some problems. I couldn't provide buyers with complete information about the product.",
          "To leave the job to pursue MBA has been the most difficult decision I had to take in life. This decision came after I had been in a stable job with decent paychecks for 7.5 years. When the time to take this decision occurred, I had just completed finishing all my family debt after saving every penny wherever possible and just bought a secondhand car for the family use. So, my savings were almost nil. At this time in October 2024, I got offer from SPJIMR to join for MBA in few months' times. This meant that I had to take new loans and had to have enough savings to survive for a year. At this time, I was also the major earner in the family and not having my income would be difficult for my family. As I have grown amidst constant financial anxiety with lot of family debt and no proper income source in the family. I have grown striving for financial stability. I worked years to achieve this and when I finally achieved this, I had to leave my job for my education. Main issues were low savings and dependent family obligations. There was also anxiety of taking new loan for the education. I had also achieved a good position in my company, and I was up for promotion in few months, and this would increase my salary by significant amount. So, uncertainty of future employment for someone like me who has worked in same company for almost 8 years was extremely scary to navigate.",

At the same time, I also passed the postgraduate re-examination. My parents were worried about the subsequent employment situation and hoped that I could work first and then continue my studies. I weighed the pros and cons in my mind and it was difficult to make a choice. On the one hand, there is uncertainty in information. It is impossible to accurately predict the changing trend of the employment situation in the next few years. I don’t know whether I can find a satisfactory job after graduating from graduate school. On the other hand, there is uncertainty in career planning and development. Parents and relatives and friends cannot give good advice. I am not sure whether I should accumulate experience through work first or obtain a higher degree to help long-term development.",

          "About personal career development. The people involved include my leaders, family and myself. The company I am currently working for was formerly a division of the parent company. Last September, the entire division became independent and established a subsidiary. At the end of last year, my leader asked me if I was willing to go to a coastal city to follow up on multiple projects there (equivalent to being stationed in a coastal city project department for a long time in the future, which may be several years or even more). If I accept, it is foreseeable that the salary level will be significantly improved, and there will be more opportunities for promotion in the future. However, after comprehensively considering my own and family situations, I chose to reject this opportunity. The first question is the location of work. I am currently at the company's headquarters, and my home is in the same city. I live with my family. In this case, my daily expenses are low (no rent, my family cooks), and the cost of living is very low compared to coastal cities, while I can also take care of my family. The second question is the issue of personal future development. Although the coastal projects will bring me a significant salary increase compared to now, in the long run, I still prefer to develop locally. Although the salary will be lower, it is more stable. The third question is that there are doubts and concerns about the new project, because the project there is a newly established project, and it is foreseeable that there are many problems that need to be solved. If it is not done well or there are mistakes, it can be said that it will be more than the gain. Combining these issues, although I also have the idea of high salary and promotion, after considering these practical problems and uncertainties, I still chose to refuse.",

          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision I have faced was whether to accept a high-paying job opportunity in another city. This decision involves me, my family, and potential new colleagues and work environment. It happened at the beginning of this year, when I received an offer from a large company in another city. The position and salary they offered were very attractive, but it also meant that I needed to leave the city where I currently live and be separated from my family and friends. Specifically, this decision involves me, because I am the one who is directly affected by this job opportunity; at the same time, it also involves my family, especially my spouse and children, because our family life will undergo major changes; in addition, it also involves my future colleagues and work environment, because this will be a new starting point in my career. The situation at the time was that although my current job was stable, the salary and promotion space were limited. This new job not only offered a higher salary, but also better career development prospects. However, it also meant that I needed to give up my current familiar living environment and start over in a completely new city. Family factors: Spouse's work and social circle: My spouse has a stable job in the current city and has established her own social circle. If she accepts a new job, she may need to give up her current job or face long-distance separation, which will have an impact on her career development and quality of life. Children's education: Our child is in elementary school, and accepting a new job means that he needs to transfer to another city, which may have a certain impact on his learning and social life. We need to consider whether the educational resources in the new city are suitable for the child and whether he can adapt to the new learning environment. Personal career development: Challenges and opportunities of the new job: Although the new job provides better salary and career development prospects, I also need to consider whether I can adapt to the new work environment and requirements. This includes new work content, team culture, management style, etc. Risks of career transition: Accepting a new job may mean that I need to transition from a familiar field to a relatively unfamiliar field, which involves certain career risks. I need to evaluate whether I have sufficient capabilities and resources to cope with this transition. Life adaptation: Living environment in a new city: I need to understand the living environment, climate, culture, etc. of the new city in order to judge whether I can adapt. Housing and transportation: Finding suitable housing and transportation in a new city is also an issue that needs to be considered. I need to evaluate my financial ability and time cost in order to make a reasonable choice. Emotional factors: Nostalgia for hometown and relatives and friends: Leaving the city where I currently live means that I will be separated from my hometown and relatives and friends, which is an emotional challenge for me. I need to consider whether I can bear the loneliness and longing brought about by this separation.",

However, although I love philosophy, I have never thought about what will happen after studying this major? How to find a job in this field to support my own life?

This happened two or three months ago.  My choice was not chaotic and was closely related to how people perceived me, which is why it did not arouse much controversy or any special actions. - Problems with roommates - going to college meant I had to change my location, which required them to look for a new roommate.  - I was often required to \"defend\" the thesis that college is necessary for anything, and opponents of this theory (which I was not even a supporter of) often used anecdotal arguments.",

After the interview, my future supervisor sent me a text message saying that he was willing to admit me, but only gave me one week to consider it. Once I agreed, I could not regret it. During this week, I was very entangled, whether to give up the unknown result and choose the current sure opportunity. My parents also persuaded me to accept the offer of my own school. I hesitated for a week, and finally rejected the opportunity to study for a doctorate at my own school and chose to continue waiting for the interview results of the top2 university.

During that time, we rushed around the streets and alleys of Nanjing to look at houses almost every weekend. After my parents learned about our ideas, they also participated in this matter. They rushed from their hometown to accompany us to look at houses, and also took out their savings for many years to support us to pay the down payment. I remember at a family gathering, everyone sat in the living room and discussed the purchase plan fiercely. My father advocated buying in Jiangning District, where the housing prices are relatively low and there is great potential for future development; my mother felt that although the old houses in Gulou District were expensive, the surrounding facilities were mature and it was convenient for children to go to school; my wife preferred Hexi New City, where the environment is good and the transportation is convenient. And I was caught in the middle. In the process of making decisions, specific problems came one after another. The first is economic pressure. The housing prices in Nanjing are not low. Even with the financial support of our parents, we still need to bear high mortgages, which means that we have to live frugally for the next ten years, and the quality of life may be greatly affected. The second is the choice of school district. The price of good school district houses is outrageous, and there is a risk of policy changes. If you buy a house but fail to enter the ideal school, all your efforts will be in vain. In addition, the newness of the house, the structure of the house, the environment of the community, etc. also make it difficult for us to make a decision. I have seen a school district house in Gulou District. Although the location and school are very good, the house is old and the internal facilities are outdated. Renovation is a considerable expense; and the new house in Jiangning District, although the environment and house type are satisfactory, the commuting time is too long and it is not convenient for children to go to school. These problems are like a mess, entangled in my heart, making me unable to make a decision for a long time, and I spend every day in anxiety and entanglement.",

The workplace bullying reminded me of my childhood experience of being bullied in school. I live in pain and plan to quit this well-paid job. It is difficult to find a new job. I failed in interviews one after another, so after quitting this job I was not sure when I would be able to find a new one.

I was offered a new opportunity that aligned with my long term goals but required stepping away from the project before its completion. The decision was tough because of the strong relationship I had built with both my team and our client pool. I had several emotional conversations with my colleagues and partner, many of whom expressed concern about the transition. Ultimately, I accepted the new role and stayed an extra month to ensure smooth handover and support the team. When making the decision, I struggled with feelings of guilt and responsibility toward the team and clients wo relied on me. I worried that leaving might disrupt the project's momentum or damage relationships I had worked hard to build.",
          "It may be more of a regret but decisions are always involved. One of the most difficult situations is the estrangement of our (my bio sister) to our stepsiblings (one set; we have two sets). What happened was that the combined children of the marriage between my mother and their father had a falling out over estate matters. It was the way things were set up with our parents where our mother and their father had each other as first beneficiary to everything. Their father died first and my mother got everything. Even though it was substantial, they both did not care of money. Anyway, when our mother died it turned out that her lifetime TDA (NYC teacher's pension) was going to her two children (my sister and I). I wish I would have coordinated everything with the siblings to keep peace but it was not meant to be. We turned the estate over to attorneys (who had a field day) and I wish we made different decisions as executor. It was not on purpose. I was struggling with addition (now in recovery for decades) and was not as responsible as I should have been. The fact is that the estate was sizable and they did get everything from their father (a piece of it). They wanted my sister and I to split the TDA, which we didn't. BTW, there are nine of them and two of us. The estate was split evenly among the 11 except for the one account.",

He had been with us since we started up the business over a decade a go and i have known him over 20 years so as you can imagine it was a extremely difficult chat and really didn't know how he'd react. He was always a good worker and he always had a good working relationship with everyone. Our business as been struggling for a few years and we had made all the cuts we possibly could without having to let people go, but in the end i had to make the decision. The decision was really hard to make as i knew this could affect my relationship with him.

This took place at our company unit in the office. The issues were things like how can i make the decision when this guy is a close personal friend. I think it would of been much easier with less personal feelings. In fact i did say to myself if/when we employed more people it would't be any family or friends. I had to show empathy towards my friend but at the same time i had to somehow put the needs of the business first.

The original division of labor has been implemented for 2 months. The development team is not familiar with the new module technology, and some people are worried about affecting their personal performance. The testing team believes that entering the development stage in advance will increase the workload, which is inconsistent with the priority of the production manager's needs.

          "This difficult decision was about whether to be honest with the senior management and postpone the redo of the company's new product promotion plan due to copyright disputes. ​ The people involved included: \"I\", the project manager of the marketing department, who was responsible for coordinating the entire project; Xiaolin, a team member, who was the key person to discover the copyright dispute; the planners, designers, and copywriters in the team, who participated in the preparation of the plan; Lao Zhang from the technical department, who proposed the difficulties of redoing the plan from the technical and time levels; and the company's senior leaders, the reviewers and decision makers of the plan, and the partners. ​ It happened late at night three months ago in the company's office. At that time, \"I\" led the team to prepare a new product promotion plan for two months, and was about to report it to the company's senior management the next morning. But Xiaolin, a team member, found that among the materials provided by the partner, there was a video idea that was highly similar to the advertisement of a foreign niche brand last year. As soon as the news came out, the team members gathered around, and their expressions changed from shock to anxiety. Lao Zhang from the technical department pointed out that with the current time and manpower, it was too late to redo the plan. \"I\" was caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, there was the temptation to advance the project on time which might affect my promotion. On the other hand, there was the risk of serious consequences such as damage to the company's reputation and project failure. After a difficult balance, I finally decided to speak frankly to my leader and apply for an extension to redo the plan. When deciding whether to be honest with the senior management about the copyright dispute of the new product promotion plan and apply for an extension to redo it, we encountered many specific and difficult problems. ​ Time and manpower pressure: Mr. Zhang from the technical department clearly pointed out that it was impossible to redo the plan with the time and manpower situation at that time. Team members have been working overtime for more than a month and are exhausted physically and mentally. If they start over at this time, not only will they have to complete a lot of work in a very short time, but they will also need to coordinate the personnel of various departments to work intensively again. Manpower allocation and time arrangement are huge challenges. Moreover, there are less than 12 hours left before reporting to the senior management. Even if they work all night, it is difficult to ensure the quality and integrity of the new plan. ​ Personal career development and risk trade-off: Promoting the project on time means that the copyright risks may be covered up. If the plan is successfully passed, this will become a key project for \"me\" to be promoted to supervisor; but once the copyright issue is discovered, \"me\" as a project manager is to blame. Not only will there be no hope of promotion, but I may also face the risk of demotion or even losing my job. On the other hand, actively admitting the problem and being honest with the senior management may be considered a work error, which will affect the leader's trust and evaluation of me, and is also not conducive to career development.​ Team morale and collaboration: Team members have put a lot of effort into this plan, and two months of hard work is facing the situation of being completely overturned, which is a heavy blow to everyone's morale. How to appease the team's emotions, make everyone willing to cooperate to resume work, and avoid conflicts and resistance within the team is also an urgent problem to be solved. Once there is a problem with team collaboration, it will be more difficult to promote the new plan. ​ Company interests and reputation: If the problem is concealed, once the copyright dispute is exposed, the company's reputation accumulated over the years will be destroyed. Not only will this project fail, but it may also affect the subsequent cooperation with partners, as well as the company's image and status in the industry; and actively delaying the redo of the plan will miss the best promotion node, which may lead to a decline in the market share of new products, affect the company's economic benefits, and also damage the company's interests. How to strike a balance between maintaining the company's short-term interests and long-term reputation is a difficult choice.",

Housing prices and commodity prices in first-tier cities are high, and I was worried that I would not be able to afford it and my quality of life would decline. Second, there was pressure for career development. Big cities are full of talented people and competition is fierce. I was unsure whether I could gain a foothold and achieve career success.

We had to reduce our operating costs, but I still needed to maintain safe and efficient service for patients. I had a small team of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians, and unfortunately, I had to consider letting someone go. One technician had been with us for years but had recently been underperforming, while a newer team member had quickly become a reliable part of daily operations.  The decision was difficult because I value loyalty and long-term commitment — but I also had to think about the overall performance and stability of the team. Letting go of a long-time staff member felt personal, and I was concerned about the impact on team morale. In the end, I decided to keep the person who best supported our current workload and patient care standards. It was hard, but I communicated the decision openly and made sure the rest of the team felt supported during the transition.

Due to some reasons, they had to sell the flat and we had to move out. My husband has his own room at his flat where the family lives together in a joint family setting, but we were not allowed to get our cats there. Hence we had to decide to take a separate flat on rent. We are now living on rent since January 2025 on a ground floor flat to accommodate the cats better, since our old flat was on the ground floor. Finances was the most difficult issue. The rent plus utilities cost around 37000 per month. Although my husband I both earn, my husband is still paying debts of previous expenses of his credit card. Another issue was the mental adaptability of paying that much rent which would inevitably require a sacrifice of certain luxuries like eating out often and buying things on a whim. Once we knew that we could financially somehow manage to live on rent, the question was how to shift the cats to a new place and whether they will get adjusted to the new place.",

The cost of living had risen substantially since we had originally rented the condo so we could not afford to rent in Vancouver while also providing our baby a decent quality of life. We made the tough decision to move to Manitoba to be able to afford a place to live while still being able to provide for our child. Securing housing and work while being in a different province was very tough. My dad was also very sick at the time, so I had a lot of guilt about leaving and taking his grandchild away from him in his final months.",

At that time, my roommates and I discussed this decision in the school dormitory, and finally we chose to continue to take the postgraduate entrance examination to improve our academic qualifications.

The issues I encountered while making the decision were mostly centered around the potential for change. One one hand, it was an exciting opportunity to grow professionally and to challenge myself, but on the other hand, there were uncertainties about how it would affect my personal life and how we would adjust to the new city. Another major issue was the financial impact of relocating, as moving would require significant investment.

At that time, I had a stable job in my current company, my family was settled in the local area, and my life was peaceful and orderly. Career development: A new job can provide a broader platform and room for promotion, but the connections and experience accumulated in the current company cannot be ignored. If I leave, it means giving up existing resources and adapting to the new environment again. I am not sure whether I can quickly integrate and achieve results. Family factors: My parents are getting older and need me to take care of them; my children are still young, and working in a different place will prevent me from participating in their important moments of growth. But if I refuse the new opportunity, I am worried about the impact on my family's economy and future development. Life adaptation: Living in a different place means renting a new house, getting familiar with the new environment, and establishing a new social circle. In addition, the pace of life and cultural atmosphere in different cities are very different. I am worried that I will not be able to adapt quickly, which will affect my quality of life and work efficiency.

My mother \"drank away\" some of that money, and with some she bought a small house in the countryside, which she doesn't want to add me to.

This decision was one of the turning points in my life and was really difficult for me because I was very interested in both fields and both would open different doors in my career. My mother and father supported me in choosing a more \"guaranteed\" profession like engineering, but they also knew my passion for art. I, on the other hand, spent days studying and preparing for exams, as well as spending time in art studios. During this process, I was under great stress due to both the intensity of my classes and the uncertainty about my future. One day, during a meeting with my guidance counselor, she guided me that I needed to find a way to combine my interests and talents. One of the biggest problems in making this decision was uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Both fields had their own difficulties and advantages, and I couldn’t figure out which one would suit me better. A second problem was the conflict between my family’s expectations and my own passions. While my family wanted a more “secure” future, I didn’t want to suppress my desire to express my artistic creativity. Finally, I also experienced a lack of information and difficulty finding the right direction; I didn’t have enough information about the career paths of graduates of both fields, and I couldn’t quite figure out what kind of university environment would suit me best.",

Given that my financial situation was difficult and my university studies were far behind, I agreed and allowed our daughter to emigrate as well six months later.

I decided to take the job and save every possible penny, although I will lose Medicaid which means my Social Securit benefit will be reduced by $185 each month. I hope I don't get sick or hurt, and psychologically I feel very worn down from trying to deal with a system that sometimes seems to penalize people for trying to do the right thing. Financial issues: the desire to earn enough money so I wouldn't be reliant on government help, but knowing that at any time I could be back where I was without the resources to requalify if I needed to.  Personal: Having to deal with a property manager who refused to understand my concerns about not being able have my rent reduced if I lost the job before next year.  Concerns about my health. It's quite good for a person of my age, but I still dread the thought ofbecoming ill or injured without having Medicaid to fill in the gaps that Medicare won't.",

          "The hardest decision of my life was to leave my steady job, where I had worked for 20 years. After the new management came in, the environment changed and my opinion was ignored. I was getting stressed every day and my health was getting worse. Finally, I decided to leave on my own. It was very difficult for me to make this decision. Because we are Kazakhs - to respect our parents and take care of them at home until their last breath is a big duty, a duty. I felt guilty, and there was pressure from society.

I took the YKS in June 2023 and after the results were announced, I had to decide whether to study outside the city or in Eskişehir, where I live. I had to make this decision on my own. My family wanted me to stay in Eskişehir. I wanted to study Public Relations and Advertising. Since Eskişehir Anadolu University was the best place to study for this department, I decided to study here. When making this decision, it wasn't just because this was the best place to study for the department. It also included problems such as financial problems, psychological problems, and fear of being alone.",

It was difficult for me, considering that I alone had to bear responsibility for my children, who were 7 and 3 years old at that time. But, I do not regret this decision now. the problem was how I would be able to financially bear this responsibility and of course it was difficult in terms of the fact that the children had to be picked up from school and kindergarten at 17:00, and my work day ended at 18:00.",

I was not sure about the cooperation I would receive from people around me. People may not appreciate good work but may criticize the shortcomings.",
          "Over the past six months, I have struggled most with whether to participate in cross-field vocational training. Two months ago, I saw a promising training course for an emerging industry at home. If I participated, I was worried that after investing a lot of time and energy, I would have difficulty entering the industry due to lack of experience, which would also affect my job; if I did not participate, I was afraid of missing out on the opportunity for transformation and promotion. I discussed it with my family and colleagues, but everyone had different opinions, which made it even more difficult for me to make a decision. When making a decision, I was faced with the fact that the professional span was large and I was afraid that I would not be able to learn it; the training cost was high and the input-output ratio was uncertain; and the training period would reduce my rest and social time, affecting my life. These problems made me feel torn about whether to participate in the training or not, and I didn’t know how to take this step.",

My mother's health is not very good. I am often worried, and I think the medical conditions at home are not as good as those in big cities. We work away from home all year round and cannot be with them. My husband and I discussed buying a small house near my home for the elderly couple. They can have an independent living space, have the good medical conditions of a big city, and be close to us for care at any time. The biggest problems we encountered are: 1. My parents don’t care about their own health; 2. They are reluctant to leave the place where they have lived all their lives. Although they want to be closer to us, they still feel that the changes in life are too great and they may not be able to adapt; 3. Buying a house temporarily is quite stressful for our family, as we do not have sufficient liquid funds.",

We were in my apartment and this fight was taking place after a night out drinking with friends. Something set my girlfriend off and things spiraled from there.

          "I faced a very difficult decision when my husband lost a lot of money gambling online. It took place just before Christmas when her was laid off for the work season. Money was already tight and he thought he could get a quick injection of cash by playing online roulette. He was drinking heavily at the time and it ended up being a horrible decision because he lost a lot of money. It made me question our relationship and whether I should walk away or stay and help him out of the difficult situation. I struggled a lot with my self-worth while making this decision. He had a lot of shame and insecurities that I had to face. He'd also done this a few years before and promised he would never do it again. It felt like a huge betrayal and I lost a lot of trust in our relationship. It also changed the way I saw him for while a while too.",

I ended up siding with this friend and completely losing touch with the other one. A main issue I encountered was who to side with and it was very difficult to use. I also had the issue of how to approach the subject of them making up with each other. I also wanted to not be involved in the disagreement and had no idea how I was going to do that.",

For the sake of the child, we talked and decided to stay together. Sometimes, I still regret not separating or divorcing at the time, since our marriage has never been the same. I had a lot of trust concerns that still exist. I was worried about bringing up our child separately. I was in fear that my partner spread infections to me in case the other party was infected.",

          "The hardest decision I've had to make in the past six months was ending a long-term relationship in January 2025. We had been together for over three years, and although we shared many good times, things had changed. Our communication broke down, and I found myself feeling emotionally drained and no longer aligned with the relationship. I spoke with two close friends and a family member seeking clarity, and after much reflection, I realized that staying was costing me my peace and self-worth. One quiet evening, I had the difficult conversation with him and explained that it was time for us to part ways. It was painful, and the weeks that followed were full of mixed emotions, but in the end, I knew I had made the right decision for my well-being and growth. It taught me the importance of choosing myself, even when it hurts. When making this decision, I struggled with self-doubt as well as the fear of regret. The uncertainty made it hard to move forward with confidence. Also, there was an emotional attachment because even though things weren't working, we had built a life together, and we had deep memories, so letting go of all that felt like grieving a part of myself. I worried that I might be making a mistake and that I wouldn't find someone who understood me the way he once did. All these issues made the decision heavy and painful, but ultimately they helped me gain clarity and grow stronger.",

I had known her for over 10 years, but unfortunately recently there had been a lot of tension and misunderstandings in our relationship.  The end of our relationship happened a few months ago, when we had a serious argument during a meeting where we had to explain our relationship.  After the meeting, we understood that our values and mutual expectations were different. The only thing I heard in my direction was criticism and accusations towards me, instead of understanding.  That was the reference point for me, at which I finally understood that I no longer wanted to see or know this person. The pressure of our mutual friends, emotions",

However I came to the conclusion after a year together that I could not see a future. I put off the decision as long as I could, as I knew how much it would hurt her but the feeling in my gut started becoming more and more intense that I had to end it, so much so I begun qestioning my own masculinity at why I couldn't face up to my own issue and be honest My ex-partner suffers from mental health issues, particularly around failed relationships and not feeling worthy, having a low self esteem.

When we got home and after we woke up, I sent her home back in a cab then later broke up with her via text message as confirmation She was crying uncontrollably but was too drunk at the time to comprehend actually what I meant.

From October, I was struggling with cash, and kept seeing that my ex was viewing my instagram story all of the sudden. I loved Charlie, and I still do. He kept spoiling me and always paying for everything because I couldn't. I would in return make the 2 hour journey to him and stay at his place. However come December, I really was struggling for cash and didn't know how I was going to afford petrol. That weekend, I travelled to Charlies, crying because I was upset that I had no money and worried about him finding out how serious my situation was. As I got there, he was annoyed at me because I was an hour late. Understandably too. But I found this to be the perfect reason to go back home and not worry about having to spend any more money with him, nor feel bad at him spending his money on me. We had a petty argument and I told him I was going back home because I didn't want to stay there that night. I was very dramatic and wasn't at all needed. But in my head I found comfort due to having no money that I could go back home. He cried, begging me to stay, I felt like shit. I felt scared. I went home, on the drive home he kept ringing me. I ignored him and cried. That night I thought, I couldn't keep this up, I wasn't eating and how was I going to tell Charlie that money was no longer here. When I would get paid they'd go straight to bills. In that moment, I decided it would be best to end it with him, to go to night school, get a new better paid job and then be able to take him back, wow him and soother him with love. So I broke up with him, over the phone. I was heartbroken, he cried like someone had died. I felt blank, numb and that the one last thing that made me smile in life, I had now damaged. We both promised we'd stay in touch and that I would never say never to us again. I started a Product management course at a school, 3 months went by, we did keep in touch but the last 3 weeks he went quiet. I messaged him asking If everything was alright. He had found another boyfriend, he told me to move on. I was then blocked from all social media. I hurt the guy I loved the most.

          "When I moved house the son of a very good long time friend of mine was our \"Estate Agent\" in the UK. Basically he is good and successful at his job but I found that he was also rather aggressive and defensive about any question or request. It ended when we moved, with him behaving very unprofessionally and shouting down the phone at me in a big rant then slamming the phone down. My friend (his mother) was to come to the house the next day to help pack up the kitchen ready for the move. She knew that her son had been very angry as he had told her and it caused a terrible wedge between us. Whilst at that time - and to date - we have not discussed the situation it has caused us to grow apart - for which I am very sorry. I don't believe my questions should have been replied to with such aggression and I believe he has some kind of anger problem. I believe she knows this also, but is not willing either to talk of it or address it to herself or him. I had to decide if I wanted my friend of 35 years to still BE a friend after the aggressive rant from her son re. our house move. I decided I would try and retain our friendship by not discussing the event and knowing that we both are struggling with it has been a strain. I had to decide whether to let our larger group of friends ALSO know what had happened and decide to just say it was a rocky time but hopefully all is well with our friendship. I had to take time out to consider all options and decide my friendship was more important than disturbing things. I guess I took the quiet, easy way out.",

We were living together in London and had been a couple for several years, sharing a life that appeared stable from the outside. Despite that, growing emotional differences and incompatible future plans made it increasingly clear that staying together was doing more harm than good. Emotionally, it was incredibly tough to walk away from someone I still cared about, knowing it would cause pain for both of us. I also struggled with fear of being alone, the not knowing of what life would look like after the breakup, and the guilt of possibly being seen as the one who gave up on it.

I have been dating a punjabi gorl for the last 2 years, but we were not a intellectual match, i was attracted to her initially because of her body but later on things didn't worked put nicely, even sometimes her parents would not approve of me. So i thought of moving on from her to another girl, who is younger , more beautiful and smart, ambitious and she is of my caste. So in january i also got connected with my other ex, my first gf...interestingly she was still interested in me and wanted to continue the relationship, but could not get over the fact that i have already slept with one girl. So, now i had to choose between the punjabi girl and the one with the same caste. Punjabi girl (khushi) used to come and visit me at my place but tanya(same caste) was in a long distance, and we didnt commit to each other. At that time in january, i was super busy with my college, life was too fast, i am pursuing my MBA from TISS, Mumbai which in itself is hard. And we were a team of six people who were organising a college level fest of footfall over 3k people and brands coming in. So life was very tough nothing was helping me, at this time tanya supported me a lot and stood by me through every corner. And i decided to break things up with khushi and told her i am seeing tanya and started dating her as my mother approves of her, yes i lied to her, because recently her father had died and i didn't wanna say that she is the reason of why i broke up with her. The issue of morality. As i was sleeping with khushi time to time, although me sexual urges were satisfied not entirely,but okayish. My intellect and my soul did not wanna be with her.

The relationship was mostly good, we had a good dynamic with each other and she was very supportive, although I sensed it was a little uneven in that she was more interested in me than I was in her. However, I was very depressed at the time due to things happening with my family and my brother being hospitalized, so I felt that I wasn't able to give much to the relationship or be a good partner, so I began to struggle with whether I should break things off because of this. My depression was really affecting the relationship and I wasn't able to be present in it. I had no other relationship experience so it's something that really caused me a lot of grief, and I really had no idea how to proceed. I wondered if I would be pointlessly throwing a good thing away if I did break things off, and I worried a lot about hurting my girlfriend if I did so. I also wondered if there was a way I could maybe just stay in the relationship and hope things would get better for me. Eventually, after a lot of thought, I decided to break things off; it felt really difficult and the conversation was painful (although she was also very understanding). Should I break up with my girlfriend? Is it worth staying in the relationship and hoping I will feel better in the future? If I break up, will I regret this in the future? If I break up, how can I make sure my girlfriend's feelings won't be hurt?

The decision was extremely painful as it meant sacrificing someone I cared about, and it not only affected us but also our mutual friends and family relationships. The specific obstacles that I experienced were fear of regret, emotional involvement, and apprehension about starting over. I also struggled with guilt about hurting someone, and anxiety regarding the reaction of others to the choice. A tremendous amount of consideration, talking it over, and ultimately, bravery were necessary in order to prioritize long-term emotional well-being over short-term ease.",

The heart is definitely deceitful, I knew how well she treated me but I didn't want to feel anything for her, but I fell-",

I was stressed with work, and coupled with constant bickering, made it hard to cope with the relationship, as there were lots of misunderstanding and miscommunication , that could not be resolved, in my opinion Specific issue i encountered when i made this decision was initial resistance. The sudden rejection and how it was conveyed led to tensed and angered phone conversation. i did anticipate this, based on previous communication with my ex, and i was not too surprised.",
          "Less than half a year ago, my ex-girlfriend wrote to me with the intention of reconnecting. We broke up against her will over a year ago and a few months later I met another girl, who I am still with today. Ultimately, I decided that I am not able to maintain contact with my ex because I still have strong but conflicted feelings for her, which could prevent me from focusing on my current relationship and I feel that it would be unfair to my current partner. I had a hard time cutting myself off from someone I still had feelings for. I felt like I had to make the right decision, one that would be good for my future and fair to those around me, but it was very unpleasant for me to make at the time.",
          "It should be that I didn't share it with other people when I broke up with my girlfriend. At about 8 o'clock in the evening, my girlfriend and I talked about the breakup in the ancestral house. In fact, there is no one's fault or responsibility. Due to family reasons, we can't be together, so we can only make this decision. First of all, we were facing the situation that we could no longer work together in the same place. In addition, our funds were reallocated and we would go our separate ways and would no longer be in touch. The biggest difficulty was sadness. I was depressed for more than two months and could not lead a normal life.",
          "My aim was to cut out of my life a person who was no good for me, even though I loved him very much. I felt the power to make this decision while talking to my best friend and in the city I lived in. It was not easy to survive that dilemma between my heart and my mind. People's reactions and the need to explain were very disturbing. And my self-confidence was very low, I felt guilty even though I was right.",
          "The most difficult decision I had to make in the last six months (January) was the one to cut off a friend completely from my life. We had been having a difficult time for a few years, leading to the time when the relationship had been mostly turbulent. What made it really difficult was the fact that we had a lot of experiences together, and we also have a lot of other mutual friends. The specific issues I had to deal with were guilt and the pain of walking away from a relationship of many years. There was also the pressure from mutual friends, which I had to deal with regularly.",
          "The hardest decision I made in the last six months was cutting off someone I deeply cared about for the sake of my mental and emotional well-being. It happened around February after I realized the dynamic was draining and one-sided. No big fights, just a quiet buildup of feeling unsupported. The main issues I faced were guilt, emotional attachment, and fear of regret. I kept wondering if I was overreacting or giving up too soon. But staying in that situation was holding me back. In the end, I chose peace over attachment, even though it hurt.",
          "The hardest decision I faced was whether to end a long-term friendship that had turned toxic. We met in college and had been inseparable for over a decade. But in recent years, she became manipulative and constantly critical. I found myself drained after every interaction. The breaking point came during the pandemic, when we had a falling out over how seriously to take COVID precautions. In 2021, I decided to stop reaching out and let the friendship fade. It hurt, and I still miss the good times, but my mental health has been so much better since then. Sometimes, walking away is the healthiest thing you can do. Guilt and emotional confusion made the decision hard. I kept thinking of the years we had spent as friends and wondering if I was overreacting. I worried about how mutual friends would react and whether I was being selfish. Part of me hoped things would get better, but I also knew that staying in the friendship was affecting my self-esteem. It took time to accept that loyalty doesn’t mean tolerating bad behavior.  ",
          "Probably the decision to split up with an ex-girlfriend in my twenties. I loved her dearly and have many fond memories of the relationship, but there were compatibility issues and she was a drinker/partier when I was not. The ultimate breakup happened while we were in Ottawa. It was quite emotional, as one would expect. Part of me still wishes it could have worked out. Consternation over whether I was making the right decision. Conflicting emotions. Avoidance, i.e. wanting to delay making a decision and causing a fight/scene.",
          "The most difficult decision I've ever had to make in my life is a personal one - the one to break ties with someone I deeply respected and cared for because continuing it meant losing a part of my self respect. Emotional instability, hours of crying, sleepless nights, frustration and self blaming in the hope that thing could have been better with a little bit of effort.",
          "Deciding to cut-out a friend from my life...it was a strange situation where she got married and the guy and his family did not turn out to be good. She would then often call me or message me to share and offload all her issues, then ask me to delete the msgs as he might check. I was worried for her safety and was initially very involved but then later she moved out and back to her mother's home so I felt more relieved. I felt like i may be giving up on my friend, which made it difficult. At the same time I had to protect my own peace, and not be her go-to person for whenever she had some issues. It seemed like one sided friendship where I was the dumping ground friend, and I wasn't comfortable with that. I also tried to guide her towards a therapist or someone trained to solve the issue, as I didn't feel I would be able to help.",
          "This decision was about heartbreak. It involved my ex that I was with 2 years ago. We were living in Alabama and had been together for a year. Things were going pretty good at first but I just started to feel like I wasn't satisfied and the spark wasn't there anymore. He was a pretty lazy and slow person so I was starting to get bored. Don't get me wrong, he was a great person and sometimes funny but I just realized he was not the person for me. I knew it was going to hurt him and I also felt hurt because I had to let him know that I no longer want to be in a relationship with him but we can remain friends. When I told him, he was really upset and down and I felt bad but, in the end, it worked out for the best. When making this difficult decision, I had a problem knowing I was going to hurt his feeling and hurt him but then I realized that I have to do what's best for me. It was difficult to break it to him because he is a good guy and deserves someone on his energy level but I also deserve what's best for me, as well.",

          "I had to make one of the most difficult choices when I chose to finish a friendship that was not good for me. One year before graduating, I noticed how scathing and unfriendly my friend was about everything I wanted to achieve. Making that decision was so tough since we had been through a lot together and knew the same friends and I worried that both our lives would be upset. I decided to take a break after trying to fix the relationship and continue sharing my concerns for my own mental and emotional health. I had to make a difficult decision which taught me how much self-honor and personal space mean. Making that decision was complicated by certain key factors. It was the emotional bond we formed that caused the most trouble, I had shared so much with that person over the years and it was painful to let go.",
          "Ending a 13-year relationship that began in adolescence was difficult due to the attachment and emotional responsibility for the other person.

After thinking about it for a few days, I decided to cancel the trip. I told them both that I cared about them too much to get in the middle of their argument.

She wanted me to move in with her and live with her. This would have allowed me to progress much faster in my life and also would have moved me into a high socioeconomic level. However, I did not feel genuine love for her and there were also several personality traits that made me worried for a long term relationship. Such as she did not value memories, only wanting to live in the present and future. Likewise, she said that if I ever got seriously injured or sick that she would leave me. I knew that in breaking up with her that I would lose a lot of potential progress I could make. Such as a higher paying job, living in a better neighbourhood and being in better living situation (apartment to large house). However, I felt that I would just be using her and that the relationship would eventually end. Mainly due to her not always being the most caring individual to most people.

She wound up locking herself in a room threatening to cut herself. I knew it was likely a cry for attention but since no one could get in we could not be sure she was not actually going to hurt herself and there was no one who could grab the knife from her. Her boyfriend was hysterical and didn't not know what to do. I had to call 911, the cops busted down her door and drover her to emergency. She did not cut herself but staff told us we should have her sectioned. I knew it would be the end of our friendship. I had to confront the very real possibility she was only threatening to hurt herself for attention, but there was a possibility she meant it and so I had to call the cops. I felt guilty but scared if I didn't things could end badly. I knew I was sacrificing our friendship on the off chance she might actually hurt herself. Having her sectioned felt like a betrayal but I was scared for her.",

It happened after years of trying to make things work, and the hardest part was choosing between comfort and personal growth. In the end, I chose to leave, knowing it was painful but necessary for both of us to move forward.   I struggled with intense guilt and fear of hurting someone I cared about deeply.

          "The hardest decision of my life was the surgery of my newborn daughter. A few days after giving birth I found out that she needed surgery because if left untreated she could die. The decision was incredibly difficult for me because I also feared for her life during the surgery. I was afraid that my daughter might die during the surgery, might not wake up from anesthesia, or that there might be serious complications.",
          "The most difficult decision was whether or not to persuade my husband to have a operation to remove his cancer. It involved me . my husband and our children.

          "The decision concerned my child's health. I was involved in it, but it concerned my child first and foremost, how she would function, how she would develop. It took place at home, it was about administering a specific medication. The dilemma is whether my decision is definitely right, whether it will not cause other problems, whether it will allow my child to live and function better.",

It's not fast work.",
          "In March, we went to the hospital ourselves, since the ambulance did not arrive for 2 hours, I had a ruptured cyst on my right ovary and needed urgent surgery and hospitalization. I did not want to go to the hospital. And I went to a second doctor for a second opinion, but he said the same thing. I was upset that I had to go to the hospital and have surgery, I really did not want all this. I thought for a long time, but then everyone persuaded me that I needed to go to the hospital, and the next morning I was already operated on in the morning. And it was terrible, they put a catheter in me incorrectly, everything hurt, when I woke up after the anesthesia, there was a tube in my throat and no one came to me, I wanted it to be pulled out, it was hard for me to breathe, my whole body was shaking like in convulsions, my arms and legs were tied, I was suffocating and shaking, I thought that I was going to die. I also could not open my eyes normally. It was terrible, I would not wish this on anyone. The doctor at the free hospital quickly diagnosed us, which made us all wary. She gave us the diagnosis without an ultrasound. So we went to a private ultrasound specialist and doctor. Well, most likely it's not a problem. I just didn't want to go to a free hospital, since I've been to such places more than once. And this whole hospital atmosphere is depressing, and they don't really help there.",

He is 7 years old, blood test results are not perfect, so the surgery was more risky than usual. The whole family was involved, my wife and two children. Of course, the adults were the ones who made the decisions, but everyone at home was going through it. The children also understood the situation, the dog is a member of the family for us. The whole situation culminated a month ago, when he underwent surgery at a veterinary clinic. Everything went well, he is healthy.

The decision involved myself and the dental office, and it was made in February 2025 (3 months ago). I was not and still am not in a great place financially.

I struggled really hard with mental health with my first child and just recently got better so I was terrified for my mental health to take a toll again. When I took the test in my bathroom at home it was positive and I remember crying to my husband and he was so supportive of my decision. My mother helped me find a good place to go and get it done and she was also very supportive of me. When I was making this decision it was difficult to get over the morality of it.

She has severe autism and has had many very serious side effects after some medications prescribed by doctors. Given the side effects already seen in many people, I thought there would be more bad side effects than benefits. Some of the doctors accepted my decision because they had already seen serious side effects with people using the medication. I stood firm in my decision.",

          "The most difficult decision for me was to get medical help with a very personal issue with my external genitalia. It's challenging to be that vulnerable, and for a stranger, regardless of being a doctor. He misdiagnosed me and treated me with a needless and very painful treatment in the office. I was living in a small town in central Alberta. The doctor was located in Drumheller, AB. My initial appointment was back in 2008. The second appointment was not until 2009. I was newly married, and it was difficult not only for me but also for my husband. The doctor I went to for treatment was not knowledgeable about the issue I presented. I was misdiagnosed and treated for the wrong problem, which led me to stay away for one year, struggling to make the next difficult decision. I went back to that doctor one year later, and he put me under in day surgery for the removal of a lesion on my genitalia, but when I woke, I was informed that under the operating lights, he chose not to touch it, finally realizing he had no idea it was this bad. I never saw or spoke with the doctor, only informed by a nurse. That doctor then retired 6 mths later. I was, however, set up with an oncologist in Calgary, AB. That is when I was later diagnosed with Vulvar Cancer. I underwent a scary radical surgery that I won't detail right now. Then, one month later, I received 35 radiation treatments to the affected area. During that time, as Calgary was too far to travel daily, I stayed in a facility, alone, without my husband to assist, during the weeks of treatments. My marriage was quite strained over the years from start to finish, and ended in 2015. I have been alone and happy since then. It was just the other day that I was reflecting on how many years since my cancer surgery. Fifteen years is a good long time and I am very proud of what I have accomplished since.",
          "The hardest decision I made in my life was about plastic surgery to reconstruct my breasts. It happened at the turn of 2024/2025. It was a hard decision for me because I had a mastectomy a few years earlier and I already knew what pain and difficulties it would involve. After a surgical consultation, I also learned that it would be a difficult surgery. However, I decided to do it. It was my personal decision, but I used the help of a psychologist to make it. Ultimately, it turned out great and I do not regret having it done. I struggled with psychological doubts and tried to answer the question of whether this was my own, deliberate decision, for myself, or whether I was doing it for someone else, to please others. I also had to collect large financial outlays exceeding my earnings and ended up having to take out a loan.",
          "Choosing whether to try for another baby or not after two miscarriages. Me and my partner involved only and nothing special was happening, it was just another ordinary day for us.

I had a polyp in my voicemail, and I couldn't get complete information from Kazakhstani doctors, so I urgently sent my daughter and my sister to Russia.

          "The difficult decision I have personally faced was to halt an x-ray examination because of a patient's rude remarks and outburst. It was a very busy night, the computer system broke down and we had to manually attend patients for their x-ray examinations. This was very time-consuming and tedious but we had to do it so that patients can be x-rayed. I had this patient who was very rude and non-compliant because he had been waiting for very long in the accident and emergency department. I apologised and explained to him that the systems were not working and everything was done manually but he just won't listen. It was a difficult decision since the doctor needed the x-ray images to know how to proceed with treatments and interventions but I just could not continue the x-ray examination if the patient would not cooperate. I did not know want the patient to have waited so long for nothing so it was a difficult decision to make. The patient also needed the x-ray images and this even made the decision more difficult to make.",
          "Should I have an abortion or not?  My boyfriend, my friend, my boyfriend's friend, and my boyfriend's sister knew. My friend provided support and advice to me, and my boyfriend's friend provided support and advice to my boyfriend, and my boyfriend's sister served as a source of advice and information because she knew the details of what it looked like and how it might feel (since their mom had experienced it too). I was 22 at the time, in college, unemployed, my parents didn't know my boyfriend yet, I wasn't ready for a baby and didn't want one, I had to make a list of pros and cons before I made the final decision. It is illegal in Poland",

I was 18 years old and had a permanent intimate relationship with her and neither of us planned it. I hesitated a lot and had to consult with my father. I asked for his guidance, but in the end she decided not to keep him. A confusion of feelings that even after so many years, 44 years later, I still feel bad for having accepted that decision and not having faced that reality, which is the blessing of a child.",
          "My most difficult decision was to agree to have a cesarean section, that is, to have my second child delivered by cesarean section. I had to give birth to my first child by cesarean section, and 6 months later I got pregnant again. At that time, the doctor said that I should have it, but since I was at risk of tearing, I gave in and agreed to another cesarean section.",

          "During the COVID pandemic my wife and I had to decide to terminate her pregnancy. It was with triplets and was deemed a high risk pregnancy. Doctors said they normally would recommend we travel to Toronto (from SK) to have a reduction to keep two but at the time there was COVID travel restrictions and we would not be able to travel. We had to decide to either keep a high risk pregnancy and risk the health of my wife and the unborn triplets or to terminate the pregnancy altogether",
          "I have an autoimmune disorder and there are more treatment options now. I had to choose whether to stay the course with prednisone and blood pressure medications or choose yearly chemo infusions. I sat with my wife and we went over the pros and cons of each path. Each has it's own unique set of side affects and challenges. This past year we chose the yearly chemo infusions. The side affects of the chemo are far less severe. Using the prednisone has hug implications with anger and short tempered behavior The only real issueas stated above were the side affects of each plan. However the prednisone route meant that I would have a flare up first and with that comes water gain and many other issues. The chemo however makes my immune system reset and rebuild itself over several months",
          "When I discovered I had breast cancer, the decision to treat it was by far the most difficult of my life. My family was involved and it happened in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic. The decision to face it with great courage and today I am fine.",
          "The specific content of the difficult decision is: whether to match and transplant bone marrow for relatives with incurable diseases. In July 2022, a relative in my family was diagnosed with leukemia. After more than two years of chemotherapy, the diagnosis still reached the last step. The reality is that bone marrow matching is imminent, how effective it will be after matching, and whether the high cost of surgery can be afforded. At the end of December 2024, my relatives and I had a long psychological preparation and repeated thinking about this decision, and finally decided to do matching. Unfortunately, my match was not suitable. Is the match suitable; will my physical condition be damaged after the transplant; what is the success rate of the matching transplant; can I afford the cost of the matching transplant, etc."

The problem was there were 2 very conflicting sides to choose from. One side had family. I hadn't seen them for many years and my father's health was deteriorating. The other side was what I wanted for myself and my own life. I much preferred living abroad and loved the place I was staying at.",

My relatives and friends are in this city. But I made this decision to be near my child. When I moved to another city at my son's request, I couldn't get used to it right away.

I was very busy at work and a new oppertunity came up but I would have to move across the country and move very quickly. Weighing the pros and cons of moving. The cost of agreeing to the decision and the benefits of staying at my current work. It created a lot of stress for me and made things very miserable.",

On the one hand, I had the opportunity to study at a university abroad, and on the other hand, due to some special circumstances of my family, I had to be with them both physically and emotionally.

The choice is difficult for me because on the one hand, my parents are no longer young, they need help, they really miss their grandchildren.

When deciding to go abroad I encountered several serious problems. First of all, there was strong opposition from my family, my parents and grandparents cared a lot about me and tried to convince me to stay in the country. Their concerns were both about my safety and whether I would cope on my own in a foreign country. Every conversation with them was emotionally difficult and I faced a huge influx of pressure causing me doubts",

This was in September 2023, when I was already struggling with separate emotional turmoil, and I had lived where I grew up my entire life. I moved to England, and although I am fully English, it was not home to me. This was a decision that involved primarily me, but also my family, who wanted me to have new experiences while I wanted to stay firmly in my comfort zone in Hong Kong. There was huge fear over everything. Leaving home, being on my own for the very first time, having to overcome anxiety to make friends, learning how to be an adult and emotional stress. I was completely unprepared, but I knew I had to make a change even though it hurt.",

Losing my steady income, difficulties in finding a new job and maintaining an apartment in the country led me to think about my whole future and take the risk of drastic changes in my life. After long conversations, I received help from friends and family, which allowed me to start in England. When making this decision, the biggest problem was financial issues. The fear of not having enough funds to start was overwhelming. The next problem was just temporary accommodation and prolonged formalities, which caused a lot of anxiety.",
          "In 2014, I wanted to go to study abroad. My mother was against it, she cried a bit. Only my father gave permission.

Due to the loss of my job due to the liquidation of our entire department in the company, and the unsafe conditions associated with the landlord of the apartment she was renting from him, I made the final decision to return to Poland. The problems were logistical; finding a company to move a van from England to Poland. And of course the emotional problems; saying goodbye to people I had known for ten years, saying goodbye to a country where I had spent more of my life than in Poland.",

This decision was difficult for me at the time, but I do not regret it. Changing my place of residence, i.e. moving to another city. The problem of finding an apartment in the city I moved to. The problem of high prices, because I had neither a job nor money when I moved.",

I was torn between advancing in my dream field abroad or staying in Türkiye to support my mother. In the end, I chose to stay with my mother. Studying abroad would open the way for me to advance in the field I wanted to pursue, but if I couldn't be with my mother, I would feel like I was betraying her, and the surgery was risky. As a result, the acceptance I received from the university, the time and money I spent were wasted, but being with my mother comforted me spiritually.",
          "I was living in Sweden. My parents wanted me to move to Canada, where they live, so they could see me more. I did not want to move to Canada, because I don't much enjoy Canadian culture, and prefer to stay in Europe and the UK when I'm able. I had been planning on spending a year in Russia, then moving to Scotland, but decided to do as my parents asked. I moved back to Canada. I knew if I moved to Canada, I would likely be stuck here for the rest of my life. If I stayed in Canada till my parents died, then moved to Scotland as planned, I would not get much pension upon retirement, as I would have spent most of my working life paying into Canada's pension plan. If I were to then leave Canada, I'd be ineligible for certain increases in pension payments that Canadian residents get. I also wouldn't spend enough of my working life in Scotland to get much pension there, either. Because I'm not in a profession where I can make a lot of money, this effectively means I can't leave here now. I knew this would happen, but I didn't want to disappoint my parents, so I moved to Canada.",

I found a job, but it was 50% of what I was making at the time. I had no family there, and had to leave my very well paid job at the time in order to move to Hawaii, with not a lot of money. Over the course of the year I came to visit Hawaii, and fell in love with it, the lifestyle and the people outside of the man I loved. A few days before my flight to move and after I had given 2 weeks notice to both my job and my apartment, I found out my partner was cheating on me. I had to choose whether or not to. move. I still moved. This was in 2012 I had to face humiliation as the community that I had grown a love to all knew I was being cheated on, and I could no longer go back to my work since I had given the 2 weeks notice and they found a replacement. I then had to move to a whole new state, with no family, by myself and deal with the repercussions of my decision to move.",

I chose to go to the USA because of the economic crisis. I worked in the fuel industry. Do not work with relatives outside. If possible, let them be foreigners. The best relationship with foreigners abroad is to work with relatives.",

          "The most difficult decision I ever had to make was choosing and accepting a job that was not close to home from me. This decision was difficult because I had grown up and spent all my life close to home, but was offered a really good opportunity that would require me to move cities for an entire year. It was difficult because I had to choose whether I wanted to be far away from my family and partner for that long for the sake of a job. I ultimately had important conversations with my family/friends/partner and decided to take the job and move away for a year. This happened about 2 years ago and I am now back home. The issues were that I needed to find a place to live for the year, so had to search for a location. The main issues though were that I struggled to make the decision to leave my family and partner for a year, since I was used to seeing them daily.",

I didn't know if I wanted it or not and the idea of staying alone and moving didn't make me feel good.

          "One of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever had to make was leaving my family behind in Mexico to move to the United States in search of a better future. This decision took place around 15 years ago when I was struggling to provide for my three children and care for my aging parents. We were living in a small rural town where job opportunities were scarce and wages were very low. I had been working multiple jobs, but it still wasn’t enough to cover our basic needs, let alone plan for the future. A trusted friend who had already settled in California encouraged me to come and promised to help me get started with work and housing. The decision wasn’t just about geography—it was about breaking my own heart for the hope of something better. The biggest issues I faced were emotional: the idea of being far away from my children, missing out on their lives, and not being physically present for my parents. There were also fears about navigating a new country, not speaking English well, and the legal risks involved. I questioned whether I was being selfish or brave. Ultimately, I chose to go because I believed that enduring short-term pain might give my children a chance at long-term stability. But it was a heavy, painful choice that still stays with me.",

This decision was driven by my future and personal development. I consulted with my parents, close friends, and teachers. This situation occurred in March when I won the study grant.

This was about 25 years ago, and I had a job offer in another part of the country which would have made it difficult to see my friends and family at the time. It was difficult due to the emotional effects of saying goodbye to friends and family and not seeing them for a long time and also the physical effects of moving to a different place and whether it would work out or be worth it.

In the living room, under dim lights, after I expressed my idea, my family members were worried. They were worried about my life in a strange city and the risks of starting a business. I was eager for new opportunities, but I was also afraid of the unknown. When making a decision, the first is the economic issue. Starting a business requires a large initial investment, and the income is unstable, so there is a worry about the capital chain being broken. The second is the emotional issue. Going to another place means being away from family and friends, and it is difficult to take care of family affection. The third is the experience issue. Although you have some understanding of the new field, you lack practical experience, and you are afraid of failure due to wrong decision-making.",

I gave out loans and dreamed of getting out of that bank as quickly as possible. Why was it a hard decision, you ask? Because I have two small children and a wife on maternity leave.

          "One of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever had to make was whether to accept a promotion at my corporate job or leave to start my own financial consultancy. This happened three years ago, when I was 36 and working as a senior financial advisor in New York. The promotion came with a significant raise and more responsibilities, but I felt a growing desire to work more closely with small businesses, particularly women-owned startups, who lacked access to affordable financial advice.  My husband and I had a young child at the time, and the idea of leaving the stability of my corporate job was daunting. My parents, who had always emphasized job security, were particularly worried. After weeks of internal struggle and discussions with my family, I decided to take the risk and pursue my own business.  The first year was incredibly challenging. I had to build a client base from scratch while balancing family responsibilities, but the freedom and sense of fulfillment I gained made it all worth it. Looking back, it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made The most difficult decision I faced was leaving my stable corporate job to start my own financial consultancy. Key challenges included financial uncertainty, family concerns (especially with a young child and my husband's own business), fear of failure, self-doubt as a woman in a male-dominated industry, and managing time between personal and professional responsibilities. After careful planning and consideration, I took the leap, and although the first year was tough, it turned out to be one of the best decisions I’ve made.",

At the beginning of this year, our company's financial situation was very bad. We didn't pay wages for several consecutive months. At this time, I actually felt a sense of crisis in my heart, and even prepared for the company to go bankrupt. How would I cope with the risk at that time? So, I wanted to resign again, but I didn't have the preparation and courage. So, I first looked for a part-time job on boss, explored the market, and started a side business. The specific problem is that I am not young anymore and it will be difficult to find a job. If I start my own business, the cost of investigation and trial is not small. At my age, I cannot make any mistakes in such a decision, otherwise it will affect my family. So I am very cautious, but at the same time I tell myself to face it and not do nothing.",

I discussed this with a few friends in a cafe near the company. Some of my friends supported me to pursue my dream bravely, while others advised me to be cautious, after all, working in a state-owned enterprise is stable. I was wavering between my dream and stability. When I decided to switch from a state-owned enterprise to the Internet industry, I had a lot of specific problems. First, I was worried that I lacked professional knowledge and experience in the Internet industry and would not be able to handle the new job. Second, I was afraid that after giving up the stable benefits of the state-owned enterprise, the new industry would not develop smoothly and my income would be unstable.

I felt sorry for the car, but I thought that I would invest money, maybe everything would work out. I started little by little, rented a space, bought goods, started working, And then Covid started. Everything was closed, there were no customers, the goods were standing, and rent had to be paid. There was less and less money, and I didn’t know what to do. I thought maybe I could hold out, but it didn’t work out - the business went bust. I was left without a car, without income.

Everyone was optimistic about the project's prospects and encouraged me to give it a try. However, my family strongly opposed it, thinking that the risk was too great. On one hand, I was eager to realize my entrepreneurial dream, and on the other hand, I wanted a stable life, which made me feel torn. When I decided to sell my house and start a business, I first faced strong opposition from my family. Family relationships were strained, and I was worried that I would be homeless and my life would be difficult after the business failed. Secondly, there are uncertainties in entrepreneurial projects. The market competition is fierce, the capital investment is large, and whether it will be successful and profitable is unknown. These made me very hesitant when making the decision.",

          "This difficult decision is about whether to quit my current stable job and start a business. It happened three months ago in my office. The people involved are myself, my direct supervisor and my entrepreneurial partner. At that time, I had worked in this company for many years, with a stable job and good benefits. But I have always had the dream of starting a business. Recently, my entrepreneurial partner found me and brought me a very promising project cooperation opportunity. I revealed my idea to my direct supervisor, who tried his best to retain me, analyzed the risks of starting a business, and hoped that I would stay in the company to continue to develop. The entrepreneurial partner painted a beautiful blueprint after the success of the business and urged me to make a decision as soon as possible. I was very entangled in my heart. On the one hand, I was reluctant to give up the current stability, and on the other hand, I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to start a business. Economic risks: Starting a business requires a lot of capital investment in the early stages. Quitting your job means losing your stable income, which may lead to financial pressure and even affect your family life. In addition, the probability of failure is high. If you fail, you may lose all your money. - Uncertainty in career development: You have accumulated a certain amount of work experience and connections in your original company, and your career development has a certain direction.

          "I am 28 years old. The most difficult decision was to quit my regular job and start my own business. I was earning a good salary in the IT industry, but my heart wanted something else - video editing, creative work. But it is not easy to leave everything and go into the unknown. My parents were worried, they said, \"You found a good job, what are you going to do?\" The financial side was also difficult - I didn't have any income right away, I doubted myself. However, I tried. It was difficult at first, but now I have my own studio and regular clients. The most important thing is that I am doing my own thing. Although it was difficult, this decision made me happy. Financial instability, self-doubt",
          "Should I quit my current job to develop a startup? There was a lot of uncertainty whether it would work out or not, I had to get involved quite a bit and my partner required me to join more full-time, and then my employer wouldn't accept a part-time job. So I had to choose between financial stability and a risky business. The fact that I will be without a permanent source of income for 6 months in a rented apartment. A lot of pressure from my partner",
          "Well basically It was when I started my own business. I had an opportunity to start a restaurant 29 years ago in the city I was living in and I knew this would be a once in a lifetime deal. I had saved a lot of money from hard work and I knew if it failed I would never recover the loss. After a lot of thought I went for it and put my life savings into a venture that had a high failure rate in that industry. I was a Chef at a popular restaurant across town and was making a great salary with 2 days off a week which is kind of unheard of in my industry. It was a really hard decision and with no partners to rely on I would have to do almost all the work myself to open it. Well the first thing was how much it was going to cost to get it fully open and functioning properly. There was also hiring the right people, getting a liquor license , menu, etc Also, there were issues of how much money I would need to cover the expenses if I wasn't doing any business. Plus, being by myself, I would have to hire a few key people that I could trust to watch my back and make sure nobody was stealing from me",
          "A difficult decision I faced was the choice to stay in a secure role that offered a predictable salary or pursue more of an uncertain venture that aligned more with my long term goals. This decision surfaced a couple of years ago when I was remote with a company that provided comfort financially, however there was very little room for growth or creativity. The new venture was a role with a startup company that was much more aligned with my interests and skillset, however the pay was not as predictable (compared to the pay of my position), and there was going to be a significant amount more work than my position at the time. The biggest issues around were the weigh out of comfort and financial stability against personal ecstasy and career fulfillment, while also reflecting on my personal work-life balance; trying to balance career aspirations of what would benefit me long term versus the short term feel of needing to be more financially stable. Additionally, I needed to think about how the decision outcome would impact the individuals that depended on me, which made the decision that much more emotional.",

          "One of the most difficult decisions I've ever faced was whether to leave a stable well paying to To pursue a passion project that had no guaranteed income . This happened about five years ago when I was working as a marketing manager at a mid size tech company. The job was comfortable good salary great team and solid benefits but I've been feeling unfulfilled for a while at the same time I'd been quietly building a side hustle creating educational content about sustainable living it started as a hobby but overtime it grew a small but dedicated audience. The problem it wasn't making enough money to support me and walking away from my job means risking financial stability. My family was involved to my partner was supportive but nervous and my parents worried about the practical side of things . The decision came To a head during a company restructuring I was offered a promotion which would have meant more money but also more hours leaving even less time for my passion.

          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision was to choose a big project internship opportunity at company A or an internship position that would keep me at company B. The people involved were myself, company A, and the interviewers from company B. It happened in February of this year. At that time, company A was a leading company in the industry. The internship position it offered could participate in the company's core projects, but the internship lasted for six months and there was no guarantee of retention. Company B was a little smaller, but it promised that as long as the internship performance was good, I could be converted to a full-time employee, and the work content was also in line with my major, but the project was relatively less innovative and challenging. When making this difficult decision, I encountered these specific problems. On the one hand, from the perspective of long-term career development, the project experience of Company A can greatly enhance my professional ability and industry vision, but there is no guarantee of retention. After the six-month internship, I have to find a new job and face the risk of unemployment. On the other hand, Company B can provide stable job security and solve the employment problem, but I am worried that my growth will be limited in a relatively conservative working environment. If I want to switch to a better company in the future, my resume may not be competitive enough.",

          "One of the hardest decisions I had to make was to quit a stable job to focus entirely on finishing my personal software development projects. I made the decision in March, after several weeks of reflection and conversations with my family and mentors. At the time, I was working from home, and although the job was secure, I felt like I was moving away from my true goal: building my career as a specialized back-end developer. The main problem was the fear of economic uncertainty and the fact of leaving behind something familiar for something that didn't yet have any guarantees. There was also the pressure not to let down those who trusted me, and the constant doubt about whether it was the right time to take that step. Making the decision meant prioritizing my long-term professional growth over immediate comfort.",
          "The most difficult decision I have ever made in my life was whether to give up a stable but lacking growth job to pursue a challenging but uncertain entrepreneurial opportunity. This decision involved me, my family, and a business partner. It happened about five years ago in the city where I lived at the time. At the time, I was working in a middle management position in a large company. I had a stable job and a good income, but my career development seemed to have hit the ceiling. At the same time, a long-time friend invited me to join his entrepreneurial project, which involved a completely new field with huge market potential but also came with extremely high risks. The main people involved in this decision were: Me: The person who was directly affected by this decision and needed to choose between stability and risk. My family: Especially my spouse, who had an important influence on my career choice because our family's financial situation and quality of life would be directly affected by this decision. Business partner: My friend, who has rich industry experience and entrepreneurial enthusiasm, is the main promoter of this entrepreneurial opportunity. Career stability and risk: The attraction of a stable job: My current job is stable, with a good income, good benefits and career development path. Giving up all this to pursue an uncertain future is a huge challenge for me. Risks and uncertainties of entrepreneurship: Although entrepreneurial projects have huge market potential, they also face multiple risks such as capital shortage, fierce market competition, and technical difficulties. I need to evaluate whether I can bear these risks and am willing to work hard for them. Family economic situation and responsibilities: Family financial burden: I have a family to take care of, including my spouse and children. Giving up a stable job may bring certain pressure to the family's finances. I need to consider how to balance the family's financial needs and my own career pursuits. Responsibility to family: I need to communicate fully with my family so that they understand my decision and share the possible risks. This requires me to have good communication skills and a sense of family responsibility. Personal ability and confidence: Self-assessment: I need to objectively evaluate my abilities, experience and resources to determine whether I have the qualities and conditions required for entrepreneurship. Confidence and determination: Entrepreneurship requires firm confidence and determination, and the ability to remain calm and optimistic in the face of difficulties and challenges. I need to think about whether I have these qualities and am willing to work hard for them. Emotions and values: Attachment to the status quo: I have a certain attachment and dependence on my current work and life. Giving up all of this to pursue an unknown future requires great courage and determination. Pursuit of dreams: At the same time, I also have a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation, and I am eager to achieve greater achievements and value through my own efforts. This pursuit of dreams and attachment to the status quo have created a fierce conflict.",

The industry in which the company was located had good prospects, but startups were highly uncertain. If the startup failed, it might affect the family's financial situation. If I left the company, it might affect the team and even future professional relationships. After weighing the pros and cons, I finally gave up the opportunity. When deciding whether to switch to a startup, I was most concerned about how to pay for my family’s mortgage and children’s expenses after my salary dropped by 30%. If my startup failed at the age of 35, it might be difficult to find a good job again. My wife and parents were strongly opposed to it, and the family conflicts put me under great pressure.

          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision was whether to leave my current stable job and join a startup. Three months ago, a friend introduced me to a startup with great potential. They offered me an important position with attractive prospects. The people involved were me, my current company leader, my family, and the person in charge of the startup. When communicating with the startup, I was attracted by their innovative ideas and development plans; the current company leader tried to retain me after learning about it; my family was worried that the risks of starting a business were high and would affect their stability. I was having a hard time choosing between stability and opportunity. When making this decision, the specific problems I encountered were: First, income stability. My current job has a stable income, but a startup company may have low salaries in the early stages or even face a situation where it is short of funds and cannot pay wages. Second, there are career development risks. I can be steadily promoted step by step in my current company, but if the startup fails, my career resume may be affected. Third, work intensity. Startups often have a fast pace and heavy tasks, and it may be difficult to balance family and personal life.",

When making the decision, the specific problems I encountered were uncertainty about the development prospects of the new company, fear of not being able to adapt to the new environment, and fear of giving up the existing stability would bring financial pressure. 1. Financial pressure: Worrying that I won’t be able to find a new job immediately after resigning, which will lead to a lack of living expenses, such as rent, utilities and other daily expenses. 2. Career risk: Unsure whether the next job will be better than the current one, and there may be a worse working environment or lower salary. 3. Social opinion: The lack of understanding from family and friends, who think it is important to have a stable job, and resigning is a risky behavior, which brings me psychological burden. 4.

My friends suggested that we start an online education project together. There was market potential but it was full of uncertainty. I was faced with the choice between stable income and unknown entrepreneurial risks. First, the economic pressure is great. If I quit my job, I will lose my stable income. I have to invest a lot of money in the early stage of starting a business. Secondly, I lack experience.

At that time, I had worked in a large company for 3 years, with a good position and salary, but I always had the idea of starting a business in my heart and wanted to do what I like.

The locations were mainly at home, coffee shops, and through online meetings to communicate with potential partners. The situation at the time was that the idea of starting a business had been brewing for a long time. I planned to do a project that combines technology and education. Through market research, I found that there was a certain potential. But starting a business means giving up a stable income, social security benefits, and the huge economic pressure that may be faced. My family is very worried about my decision, especially my parents. They think that the risk of starting a business is too high and hope that I will stay in the company and continue to work. 1. Financial pressure. There may be no income in the early stage of starting a business, and you may even need to invest a lot of savings. If you fail, you may face financial difficulties. 2. Family opposition. Although my parents and boyfriend support my dream, they are more worried about practical problems, such as mortgages and living expenses. 3. Psychological pressure.

I received an offer letter from a professional counterpart company, and at the same time, I also developed a strong interest in the self-media industry. My parents wanted me to choose a stable professional counterpart job, but I yearned for the innovation and challenges of the self-media industry. In the dormitory, I repeatedly thought about my future career direction and fell into a dilemma. When making this decision, I encountered the following specific problems: On the one hand, I was worried that it would be difficult to achieve results after giving up years of study in this major and entering a new field of self-media, and I would face tremendous pressure to start from scratch. On the other hand, the self-media industry is developing and changing rapidly, the competition is fierce, and the future is full of uncertainty. It is difficult to predict whether it will succeed.

They contacted me falsely accusing me of sending an illegal parcel to Iran and subjected me to intense questioning. The entire ordeal was harrowing and left me feeling extremely vulnerable. The incident occurred one morning as I had just arrived at my office and was about to begin my day. The scammers initiated contact presenting themselves as representative of FEDx courier company and later routing it to the CBI officials, and began their interrogation. By the time I realized that I was scammed it was a little too late. However I immediately hung up and called the national cyber helpline no to report the incident. Later I filed an FIR about the scam at the local police station and informed my bank about the same.",

I had to begin selling them off in order to survive.  I did most of this on my computer, on the go, or at my house over the last 6 months. The issues from this difficult decision didn't really arise during the decision making process. It was a result of lots of incompetency from people who managed my money.

Not to get too friendly because then some colleagues do not hesitate to take advantage of your emotions and hurt you. My senior colleagues and I were involved in a research project that was going on for a long time. In between all this, I received a promotion and was promoted from associate professor to professor. This was not liked by these colleagues, and in one of the research meetings, it came out in the open where as if getting a promotion was all my fault. The issue was, I started thinking within, as to how I could not assess these people at the beginning. Why did I take them as close friends, devoid of all the negative feelings?",
          "The most difficult decision was recently when I had to decide if I wanted to leave my job due to horrible management, low compensation, and working hours past my scheduled shift. I consulted my father, mother-in-law, wife, and coworkers who gave me some advice. I was skimming through other jobs I am qualified for, but was also deciding if I would regret leaving my job in the future. I thought about compensation changes, how it may affect my relationship with my coworkers, and how I may regret leaving the job if I changed jobs and realized I had it better at my current job.",

Two months ago, I received an offer from this company in another city, with a salary 50% higher than my current job. After learning about it, my direct supervisor tried his best to retain me and promised me a promotion opportunity. My family was worried that it would be inconvenient for me to take care of the family after I went to work in another city. I was in a dilemma and didn't know how to choose. When making this decision, the specific problems I encountered were: First, I was worried that the new working environment would be unfamiliar and it would be difficult to integrate into the team, which would affect my career development; second, the current unit leader wanted to retain me and promised me promotion, but I was not sure whether it was a delaying tactic or sincere, and I was afraid of missing out on the promotion opportunity; third, in terms of family, working in another place would prevent me from being with my family at all times, and it would be difficult to balance work and family responsibilities.",
          "This was a decision to change my job. My job for 5 years was stable and reliable. But I wanted to look for new opportunities. 1 reason was that I felt like I could develop professionally in my new job, new opportunities, and a high salary. 2 reason was that it was a prestigious job, with very good additional bonuses. It was in September 2024. I made a decision with my boss and family. I passed the test related to my field without a hitch, but the answer was that I failed the verbal and logical test, which was not related to my job. But I was told that we were not obliged to answer the question of how and why I failed. We did not talk about the human factor face to face. My family was worried about my decision, as the job was on the outskirts of the city.

Around 5 months ago they put me on a project that was supposed to last for a month, then two months, and it ended up lasting four months. Every single day I dreaded coming to work, so I ended up having an interview for a competitor and thought that I was going to leave my current company for another one. They said they were interested and I spoke to my company about it and told them that I was thinking about leaving and my manager told me they were going to take me off the project and put me on a better one but it was just going to take some time. In the end I decided to stay and trust they would keep to their word, which they did. I had to weigh up the pros and cons of whether to take the job and change the routine at a place I have been the last 13 years or move on to a new challenge. The new job was in a different area so I would have probably had to move house and uproot with my partner so I was quite happy to stay in the end but I wouldn't have been able to stay on the project because it was destroying my happiness.",

I was in a semi supervisor role, making pretty good money at the time, and had lots of co-workers who were my friends at the time. My job was secure and the company was doing very well to my knowledge. The new job was paying a lot more than I was making and I had no experience in that field at all. Somehow I had passed the qualification test in mechanical aptitude, and was offered the position, starting at more than double my current wage.. My current employer would not give me a reference and would not help me at all in leaving my position. All my friends turned on me and stopped even calling me anymore.",
          "At the beginning of February this year, just after the Spring Festival holiday, I was urgently recalled by the company. As the deputy manager of the marketing department, I had to decide within a week whether to accept the transfer from the headquarters and take over the South China branch that was on the verge of dissolution. ​ The reason for this was that the performance of the South China branch continued to decline. The company's senior management lost confidence in the head of the branch, Mr. Li, and planned to lay off the entire department. Mr. Li and I have been friends in the workplace for many years and have worked together to start a business. Mr. Li is a righteous man. When I encountered setbacks when I first entered the workplace, he helped me and gave me opportunities many times. Most of the members of the South China team he led were old colleagues who had fought side by side with me. Some of them had just taken out loans to buy houses, and some had young children. Once the department was disbanded, these people would face the crisis of unemployment. But the transfer conditions of the headquarters were indeed attractive. If the South China branch could be revitalized, I would be directly promoted to the general manager of the marketing department, and my salary and career development prospects would be greatly improved. But the reality is not optimistic. The competition in the South China market is extremely fierce, the branch is short of funds, and the team morale is low. It is not easy to reverse the situation. If I still cannot change the current situation after taking over, not only will my professional reputation be damaged, but the situation of Mr. Li and his team members will become even more difficult. During the week of making the decision, CEO Li talked to me many times, expressing his reluctance to leave the team and his concerns about the future. The leaders at the headquarters kept putting pressure on me to give a response as soon as possible. My family also had different opinions. My wife was worried that working in a different place would affect the family, but my parents wanted me to seize this promotion opportunity. I was caught in a double dilemma between friendship and future. Every choice was heavy and suffocating, but I had to make the final decision.",

My colleagues and I were faced with the question of whether to renew our contract. The company has been talking about relocation, but the relocation time has not been determined, and my contract will expire at the end of the month. Commuting time is the first problem. Currently, it takes me 10 minutes to get to the company every day, but after the relocation, it will take at least 1 hour one way. The commuting cost and time cost will increase greatly, which means that my original regular life rhythm will be completely disrupted, and my rest time will be greatly reduced. At the same time, the company has not announced any compensation measures for employees regarding the relocation. If I choose not to renew my contract, I may be able to receive unemployment benefits, but the current job market is highly competitive, and it is full of uncertainty whether I can find a job with comparable and suitable treatment.",

In April2020 end we had to decide if we will be able to pay the full salaries of all the people on the rolls. I discussed with the owner-MD of the company and much as we would have disliked it, we took a call to have a graded reduction in the salaries for at least April, and to indicate the pain may last for 3 months. We did not give full salaries for April, and even the lowest levels had some small cuts - this was a very difficult decision The cuts varied from 10% to 90% from lower levels to higher levels of the hierarchy 1. some employees obviously asked as to why we are not giving full salaries since we may have had reserves and surplus and sufficient cash in hand. However our debt/equity ratio was way beyond 2.5 and we were indeed having funding crunch and hence this was explained to them. 2. Some of the union employees themselves came forward and agreed to participate in the cut, saying that this was their chance to show that they are with the company and agreed to a 10% cut. 3. We were also unable to give a firm timeline until when the cuts would be in place. We held multiple Zoom calls and everyone was called to attend from their homes (since quarantine protocols were in place) and that itself was also a difficult decision. 4. During the zoom calls we first about their health and wellbeing, asked other details, explained our situation at the factories and offices, and then customers, and then revealed about the intention to implement this and seek their reaction. 5. The HR then connected subsequently with each of them too, to follow up for any other doubts. We got the whole hearted support of everyone, even though they themselves were feeling uncertain.",

Two months ago, the company talked to me and proposed to transfer me to a branch in a neighboring province as a department manager. The people involved were me and my direct supervisor. At that time, I was very conflicted. If I went, I would have career development, but I would be away from my family and friends and face challenges in a new environment; if I didn't go, I was worried about missing out on a rare opportunity. When making a decision, the specific problem is that it is difficult to balance career and family. I am worried that I can't take care of my family in a different place, and I am not sure whether I can adapt to the new work environment and interpersonal relationships.

I would move from having clear objectives to my work and autonomy to pursue things, to a new set goals aligned to the people that work for me.",

After listening to my report, my boss gave a different opinion on my plan, but in fact, what he said was too idealistic and could not be realized in reality. However, he was very confident and thought that there was no problem with his plan. I was faced with a difficult choice, whether to stick to my own direction or compromise and choose the boss's suggestion. After a psychological struggle, I still discussed with my boss and explained the unfeasibility of his suggestion. After a long communication, things finally took a turn for the better. I can study this plan again and give it a chance to revise it. I was worried that my boss would be upset by my objection, which would harm my career. I was also worried that after I told my boss, it would be ineffective and my boss would still insist on his own opinion and not care about my opinion.",

I was having issues with weighing the pros and cons of changing teams. If I switched teams, I can learn new skills and it could lead to more opportunities in the gaming industry.

The new manager, on the other hand, was demanding, cold, and sometimes made unfair decisions. The pressure on the team increased, and people started leaving. Uncertainty and fear I thought about how difficult it would be to find a new job if I quit. Losing income in such unstable times is a big risk. I had to deal with this uncertainty every day"

Not to say that they are monsters or criminals at all but, just that I have found that dynamics have changed in the family at times and I feel that things need to be discussed and hopefully, sorted out. However, my family generally seems happy with the current situation. I feel that it is mainly of their making and so I have to be careful with how and how much I interact with certain members.That is not to say that I have been 100% perfect either but, I do want to work on things. Feelings of guilt and remorse for not being 100% perfect in terms of the dynamics. I, however, know that relationships are a two-way street.

Therefore, I decided to support my daughter in her decision to divorce her husband. Of course, I would like my daughter to be happy and for my granddaughters to live in a complete family. The biggest problem was that the children suffered the most in this situation, screaming at night, bad sleep, although they are not guilty of anything.

And this decision was very difficult. In fact, at that time, my inner instinct was screaming at me not to give consent, but I ignored it. My mother, everyone close to me, was of age to get married, and I did not say that if I did not agree, I would never leave, so I gave consent. It's been about 8 years now. We have 2 children, but my partner and I are like two worlds apart, our views on life, thoughts, even our actions and thoughts about the future are all different, we have nothing in common that unites us except our children, we don't even have any common stories, everyone seems to be living their own lives.

I decided to stay at home and finish work so that the children could get collected The issue was emotional I wanted to be in 2 places at once do it was very difficult.. I felt awful",
          "I was married, had given birth to my first child and due back to work 4 months after she was born because we couldnt afford for me not to work. I lived over an hours train journey away from work, in London. So it was a 4 hour round trip every day to work. but our mortgage was tied up with the bank i worked for and i knew if i did not go back to work, we would potentially lose the house, We were hard up already, i had post natal depression, but i had to make the choice to go back to work. Which i did. The issues were around my physical and mental health. Every day was a struggle, I was exhausted. I was not bonding properly with my daughter as i simply had not enough time spent with her. So i believe it must have had an impact on her as well which made me feel very guilty",
          "when my wife asked me to pick between her and my mother i didn't know who to pick",
          "This decision was about whether to have a child with my second (current) husband. It mainly involved me, my husband, and secondly, our respective parents and children. At that time, I was 10 weeks pregnant but the fetus stopped growing. After the operation, I took a break for a while. I considered that I was already 39 years old and it might take a more relaxed state to get pregnant again - I needed to quit my job and rest at home, and my husband, who was not working at the time, asked him to go to work. But after repeated discussions, the final conclusion was that he was unwilling to work, so I also said that I would not have another child. Specific problem: Having a child together is our common wish and also the bond of marriage. Due to my age and the fact that I have had a miscarriage, I may not be suitable for a smooth pregnancy and childbirth while working. Having a child without family income is a strong sense of insecurity for women. I asked my husband to work. But he has his own plans. He is unwilling to work to earn income in the next one or two years. He has longer-term plans to prepare. Since we are a remarried family, we do not have common savings and assets. All common property is only in the cash flow of the family. Once both of us are not working, it means that we need to spend our original savings. On the one hand, there is a sense of insecurity. On the other hand, I also need to pay for the support of my original child. If there is no income supplement, the pressure will increase. Therefore, under the realistic situation, I finally chose to give up the idea of having a child.",
          "The most difficult decision in recent times was having a child without being married. It concerned me, my child and my family (parents, siblings, immediate family). Difficulty and fear of confessing to family, especially parents. After confession - huge negativity from family, especially from mother.",
          "Resigning from the name because I had a baby was the hardest decision I've ever made in my life. Everyone intervened. They gave advice and tried to dissuade him.",
          "The hardest decision I've had to make is whether to be a wife or a mother. My husband had been in a minor car accident. We had an argument, and he physically assaulted my son and me. I made the decision to be a mother before becoming a wife. The problem is that I didn't have my own house, my husband was in recovery, it hurt me to leave his house before we were attacked more, and now I have to pay rent and get by alone with all the obligations.",
          "After 3 years, I was leaving my daughter and starting work. My mother was going to look after my daughter, but this situation made me very sad. My daughter's sleep pattern was disrupted. She cried a lot, and I cried as she cried. Unfortunately, life circumstances required this.",
          "In 1999, I found out that the mother of my son was involved in prostitution. I made the decision to leave her and take my 3-year-old son with me so I could raise him myself. I separated what belonged to my son and took him to my mother’s house, based on a legal agreement drafted by a lawyer, given all the circumstances and everything that had happened!",
          "I had to make the decision, with my husband, to curtail fertility treatments in the hope of having a second child. The issues I encountered were weighing my desire for a second child against the cost and disruption to our lives involved in fertility treatments. Pursuing the treatments meant sacrificing quality time with the child I already had, as well as undergoing the stress of failed treatments and the pressure I felt from my boss at work when my schedule was disrupted by the need to go to medical appointments. On the other hand, both my husband and I really wanted to have a second child.",
          "I think it was deciding whether to accept a post-doc position I'd been offered. It was in the US, and I was due to have a baby in July, and the position started in September. The only way my husband and I could think to make it work (since I did need to be there at least part of the time), was to leave for 2-3 weeks at a time starting in November, and then be home for 2 weeks. Which meant that I would a) be missing out on time with my baby, and b) my husband would have to be her full-time parent for those weeks I was away, while working remotely full-time (he couldn't get paternal leave). Well, the emotional one was the biggest. I didn't want to leave my baby, since I knew there was going to be so much I'd miss out on. At the same time, I knew this step was vital for my career. I also knew that it would be difficult for my husband to handle the baby on his own (this turned out to be fine for the most part), as that is a lot of extra work for someone who is also working full time, so I worried about his mental health. I worried about my own mental health, and how it would be affected by being away from my family so often.",
          "The hardest decision was whether to have a child alone or not when I got pregnant and my boyfriend refused and insisted on an abortion. It was 12 years ago. At that time, I had been working in a prestigious oil and gas company for about a year. My mother had stomach cancer. We all lived in a two-room apartment, including my sister and my mother's husband. The relationship with the guy seemed stable and serious. Pressure from relatives, condemnation, guilt, huge fear, the guy left, I practically lost my high-paying job because I didn’t work for a year and due to stress I showed poor results, they didn’t extend my contract, I had to fight with them for maternity benefits, in the end they extended the contract until the child reached 3 years of age.",

I never told them, my mom took me to the drs. and he said I was too far long for an abortion. So then we had to go back home and my mom told my father. He never said a word to me about it. Whether I was going to keep it. How was I going to pay for all the stuff it needed. Wondering what my family would say. They never said anything directly to me. But everyone came around to see the baby once she was here.",
          "My husband and I had been trying for nine years to conceive a child. We had multiple failed fertility treatments. It was October 2024. We had a contract with a fertility company to obtain five lots of donor eggs. If we did not conceive through donor egg IVF and have a baby, we could get our money back. We had already used one lot that had resulted in a miscarriage after two Donor Egg IVF treatments. We previously had done two full rounds of IVF with my own eggs. We had to decide if we would select another donor and move ahead with another round of DEIVF, or stop fertility treatments. If we did not select another egg lot, we could receive 50% of our money back. Specific issues involved our mental health, the toll of the fertility drugs on my body and mental health, our faith in what we believe God had promised us about having children, and finances.",
          "8 years ago I decided to have a child. It was not easy because doctors said that I had health problems and I would not be able to give birth. The problem was complicated by the fact that my boyfriend at that time made mistakes and had to sell his business, and we wanted to get married before the birth of our daughter, but he lost the documents and behaved irresponsibly.

She, my son, and I all participated. I made the decision at home with my son. My son was upset because he discovered his mother's priorities didn't include him.

My partner only worked part time because my eldest son was only at nursery part time. He remained at home with our son when I returned to work the first time around. I think one of the biggest issues was the feeling of overwhelming guilt - that I was abandoning my baby because we were financially unable to cope if I didn't. I felt bitter that other mothers had more time with their babies and felt that our bond would suffer. I felt like I would miss important milestones in her development and it impacted my mental health.",

I also talked to the company's human resources specialist. Since I have passed the teacher qualification exam and tutor my own children, I'm familiar with the course and overall it's going relatively smoothly.

I faced a difficult choice whether to stay at work with my brother or leave my brother alone, and I would start looking for a better-paid job in IT, specifically programming.

I work for a company that rents apartments on a short-term basis. No one from the company cooperated with us, they did not help much with the move, there were many unknowns and problems that we had to solve ourselves from the reception area. In addition, the apartment coordinator responsible for the condition of the rooms was difficult to cooperate with, because she often did not do her job properly, which is why we as the reception had many unpleasant situations with guests. They also cut our salaries. The decision was difficult due to the current situation on the job market, where it is really not easy to find a job. On the one hand, I have to earn money, so I would gladly stay, but the vision of a very difficult job market and the vision of many problems that were to come in the coming weeks due to the move put me in a great state of resignation, because I knew that I would either give it up and be unemployed for an indefinite number of days, weeks, months, or I would have to suffer.",

          "The most difficult decision: whether to give up the opportunity to study abroad to take care of a seriously ill family member Time: August 2018 Location: Beijing (home) and Boston, USA (location of the admitted school) People involved: me (22 years old, a fresh graduate), my mother (cancer patient), my father, my boyfriend (now husband), and a study abroad agent Background: In the spring of 2018, I received an admission letter from the School of Communication at Boston University in the United States (full scholarship), and planned to go to the United States in September to pursue a master's degree. At the same time, my mother was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer during a routine physical examination and needed to be hospitalized for chemotherapy immediately. My father was stationed abroad for a long time due to the nature of his work, and the responsibility of taking care of my mother fell almost entirely on me. Key conflicts and details: The fierce collision between family responsibilities and personal ideals: After my mother learned about her illness, she insisted that I \"don't give up my dream\" and even secretly contacted the agent to inquire about the possibility of delayed enrollment; but my father told me privately that the doctor assessed that my mother's remaining survival period might be less than two years. \"She doesn't say it, but she counts the time when you go home every day.\" My boyfriend (who had been in love for 3 years at the time) works in Beijing and said, \"I can move in with you to take care of aunt, but you have to think clearly. Giving up this opportunity may mean missing out on the top resources in the industry forever.\" (He is in the international consulting industry and knows the impact of academic qualifications on career development) The double pressure of reality: My mother's treatment requires huge expenses (targeted drugs cost 32,000 yuan per month out of pocket), and my undergraduate savings are only enough to pay for 3 months of expenses. If I go to the United States, I need to start the house selling procedure immediately, but my father firmly opposes (the property is my mother's pre-marital property and carries her childhood memories). Boston University stipulates that \"scholarship quotas cannot be retained until the next year\". If you give up that year, you will need to reapply at your own expense in the future (estimated cost exceeds 800,000 yuan). The feeling of tearing in the decision-making process: While accompanying my mother in the hospital for two consecutive weeks, I hid in the stairwell every morning to communicate with the professor via Skype, trying to \"complete the first semester course remotely\", but was rejected by the hospital on the grounds that \"media majors need to participate in projects on site\". During the interval between my mother's chemotherapy, my father quietly helped me pack my luggage, but when I found out, he turned his back and said, \"Your mother has never lived for herself in her life. Don't let her feel that she is a burden to you.\" This sentence made me break down and cry in the corridor of the ward. The final decision: A week before school started, I submitted an application to Boston University to give up admission, and quietly placed a copy of the admission letter on my mother's bedside. That night, she touched the paper and choked and said, \"I'm sorry.\" I held her hand with an IV tube and replied, \"You grew up with me, and I grew old with you. This is not an exchange, but what I want to do most.\" Conflict between family responsibilities and personal ideals: taking care of a seriously ill mother vs. studying in the United States (full scholarship + top resources). Financial pressure: high cost of treatment (targeted drugs cost 32,000 yuan/month), disagreement on selling the house (father opposes selling mother's pre-marital property). Timeliness of opportunity: scholarship quota cannot be retained, and it needs to be re-paid at one's own expense after giving up (estimated to be over 800,000 yuan). Emotional tug: mother insisted on letting me go, father hinted that she didn't have much time left, boyfriend reminded of career risks. Uncertainty about the future: giving up studying abroad may affect the starting point of career, and staying requires planning life from scratch.",
          "I am on maternity leave, 5th year. I gave birth to my eldest child in 2020, and 2 years later to my second child. This year the youngest is 3 years old and I had to decide whether to go back to my main job. At my previous job, the work schedule with constant delays until late did not work out, since I have to pick up the children from kindergarten myself, I had to look for a suitable job, change my field of activity loss of qualifications, job search, lack of support at previous place of work. mothers with children have it harder than men. life is mostly on women's shoulders",
          "Difficult decision: whether to end a long-distance relationship and return to hometown to work Time: March 2025 Location: Shanghai (workplace) and Tianjin (hometown) Involved people: me (27 years old, Internet operation), boyfriend (now fiancé), parents, direct supervisor Background: I have worked in an Internet company in Shanghai for 4 years. In early 2025, I was promoted to operations manager, responsible for key projects; my boyfriend works in the Tianjin system, and we have been in love for 3 years and planned to get married in October 2025. In early March, my boyfriend's unit had an internal transfer opportunity, and he could help me apply for an operations position in a state-owned enterprise in Tianjin (salary reduction of 30%, but stable job). At the same time, my parents mentioned many times that \"the only daughter has been away from home for a long time, and there are great concerns about retirement\", and they hope that I will return home. Key conflicts and details: The collision between career prospects and marital stability: The Shanghai team is preparing for a listing project, and the leader hints that \"staying can get options\"; but the position in Tianjin belongs to a traditional industry, and the digital transformation is slow, and there are concerns about the \"degeneration\" of professional skills. My boyfriend confessed: \"I can accept living apart for another year, but my parents want us to have a baby as soon as possible after marriage, and you are alone in Shanghai with no one to take care of you during pregnancy.\" (He once missed my acute appendicitis surgery due to overtime work, and he felt guilty about it) The realistic pressure of living in two cities: The round-trip high-speed rail fee is 1,200 yuan per month, and we only spend 2 days together on weekends. Both parents require \"living together for at least half a year before marriage\"; if we continue to live apart, we will have to bear the wedding preparations, decoration and other matters alone. The monthly rent in Shanghai is 4,500 yuan (accounting for 20% of the salary). If you live at home in Tianjin, you can save money, but you need to adapt to the change from \"independent living\" to \"living with your parents\" (my mother has mysophobia, and we once had a quarrel over living habits). The sense of pressure of decision-making deadlines: The deadline for state-owned enterprise recruitment is March 15 (a resignation certificate must be submitted), and Internet companies require confirmation of retention intentions before the end of March (otherwise the quota will be given to newcomers). When I was interviewing for a job in Tianjin, the HR asked, \"At your age, if you return to a second-tier city, have you ever considered the bottleneck of your career in the future?\" I cried all the way on the subway. Struggles in the decision-making process: Make a \"pros and cons comparison table\": Staying in Shanghai: Advantages (high salary, fast growth, option potential), Disadvantages (delayed wedding, parents' concerns, difficult childcare after childbirth); Returning to Tianjin: Advantages (stable marriage, low cost of living, close to parents), Disadvantages (salary gap, industry ceiling, zero connections). \"5-year deduction\" with my boyfriend: If I stay in Shanghai: I will need to hire a nanny for childbirth in 2026 (estimated monthly expenses of 8,000 yuan), and I may face \"forced interruption of career growth\"; If I return to Tianjin: I will spend 3 years learning the survival rules of state-owned enterprises, and at the same time try side jobs (such as operating self-media) to make up for the income gap. I called my father late at night, and he said, \"We don't want to tie you down, we're just afraid that when you get old and look back, you'll find that the people you love most are all regrets.\" Final decision: Submit resignation application from Shanghai company on March 12, accept the offer from Tianjin state-owned enterprise. Core considerations: Marital relationship takes precedence over short-term career gains, the \"35-year-old crisis\" in the Internet industry is imminent, and working within the system can provide stability during the child-rearing period. Use \"compromise plan\" to reduce losses: keep renting in Shanghai until the end of 2025 (store personal belongings + occasional business trips), update the public account of operational dry goods every week after joining Tianjin, and maintain industry sensitivity Conflicts in career development: Shanghai has options and promotion opportunities, while Tianjin's industry development is limited and salaries are reduced by 30%. Marriage and family pressure: Being in a different place affects marriage plans and childbearing arrangements, and parents hope that their children will be close to them for retirement. Economic considerations: Shanghai has high rents and round-trip fares. Although Tianjin saves money, its salary is reduced, and it is necessary to re-adapt to the lifestyle. Time is tight: The recruitment of state-owned enterprises and the confirmation of the intention to stay in Shanghai companies overlap, so a quick decision is needed. Future uncertainty: Staying in Shanghai faces conflicts between childbirth and career, and returning to Tianjin is worried about the elimination of personal connections and the early arrival of career bottlenecks.",
          "I had to leave because the cost of daycare increased because there was no one to look after my child. 2 years ago. It was either my career or my child. I knew I would face financial difficulties. I thought a lot about getting out of the job and the workplace caused problems.",

          "I do an aftercare school program and recently there was a family in my neighbourhood who asked if I could watch their son as well after school. I already feel at capacity with the five kids I watch already, and so I felt like I needed to say no. It's tricky because as a stay at home mom any extra income is awesome and very needed but I also don't want to feel stressed about adding one more kid over to my house after school and feeling more stressed. The issue was this family needed childcare and wasn't able to find anyone else. The issue was my house is small and I already watch five kids after school (including my two girls) and it's been going well- though those five kids are already quite active and it's busy! Our mortgage is up for renewal this September and the rate will be higher- so I defenitely would love to make as much extra money as I can- but I really felt like it wasn't a good idea to add another kid after school, as much as it would've been nice to do that financially.",

About ten years ago, when my child was just one year old, we were at home. I successfully interviewed a company with good salary and benefits, but the only drawback was that I had to travel frequently for long periods of time. However, my child was too young at the time and my parents were getting older, so they both needed someone to take care of them. When making this difficult decision, I encountered the problem that if I were on a long business trip, my children would be too young to be with me often, and my parents would not be able to take good care of them, so I felt guilty. I was also worried that the long-term separation from my husband would affect our relationship.",

Everyone pushed me and I didn't want to go. I discussed it with my family, but they also disagreed, thinking that this was not a wise choice. After a long ideological struggle, I thought that what my family and colleagues considered needed to be considered, and I would find a good person for myself. At the same time, I hoped to seize this opportunity, which was a good opportunity for me to grow and learn. Finally, after several struggles, I chose to go. I encountered safety issues when going to Thailand. Secondly, there was the language problem. Thirdly, there were cultural differences in managing foreign personnel.",

          "1. Background details of the difficult decision Decision topic: whether to accept a promotion opportunity in a different city, while facing the conflict between family responsibilities and career development. Time: March 2025 (within the past six months). Location: Current home in the city, final decision made in the office after communicating with family. People involved: Me (32 years old, project manager of a technology company) Wife (teacher, stable job, currently living in the city with a regular position) Two-year-old daughter, both parents (wife's parents are local, my parents are out of town, need to help take care of the child) Events: Opportunity: In early March, the company headquarters (located in another provincial capital) proposed to promote me to regional manager, with a salary increase of 40%, but I had to take up the position within three months. This is the first high-level promotion in my career, and the core team resources and industry influence have been significantly improved. Family conflicts: My wife cannot transfer jobs in the short term (local schools require 5 years of service, and we have just completed 3 years). If I work in another place, we will become a \"weekend couple\". My daughter will be taken care of by my wife alone. Both parents are old and cannot stay at home to help for a long time. My daughter has just entered the childcare class and is in the critical period of parent-child attachment. My absence may affect her sense of security. Realistic pressure: The current city where I live has high housing prices, and the monthly mortgage payment accounts for 35% of the family income. The salary after promotion can alleviate the economic pressure, and the educational resources in the headquarters city are better, which is beneficial to the child's future in the long run. Although my wife supports my career development, she is anxious about the pressure of raising children alone, and both parents have also euphemistically expressed their concerns about the \"burden of raising children across generations.\" 1. Conflict of values: family vs. career Career level: promotion opportunities are scarce (only 2 people in the same department were nominated), and if I give up, I may miss the 3-5 year development window; there are top industry mentors in the headquarters team, who can directly affect my future transition to the senior management level. Family level: My wife once gave up an opportunity to transfer to another place for my career development. If I choose to move to another place at this moment, it may lead to a long-term imbalance in the division of labor in the family and even affect the marriage relationship. My daughter only has one chance to grow up, and I feel guilty for being an \"absent father\". 2. Information uncertainty: future risk assessment Career risk: The new position needs to lead the integration of cross-regional teams. There are disputes within the company about the resource investment in this business line. If the performance does not meet the target within 1 year, there may be a risk of transfer or layoffs. Family risk: Long-term separation may lead to alienation between parents and children. If the wife's psychological pressure accumulates, it may cause family conflicts; whether the cost of living in another place (such as rent in the headquarters city) offsets the salary increase needs to be calculated in detail. 3. Emotional and rational game Emotional restraint: Reading picture books with my daughter every night and taking her to the park on weekends are the times I cherish most. I have strong emotional resistance to imagine that I can only participate in these scenes through video in the next six months. Rational trade-off: Make a decision matrix to compare the pros and cons (see the table below), but some factors (such as \"the lack of fatherly love in the child's childhood\") are difficult to quantify, resulting in a deadlock in rational analysis.",

          "It was 2019. I had been working as a supervisor in a hardware store in Karaganda for three years. The company's regional director offered me a vacant position as a store director in the south of the country. To do this, I had to move to another city with my common-law wife. First of all, the language barrier stopped me. I had already been on a business trip to Kyzylorda twice, and it was difficult to communicate with employees and customers due to my poor knowledge of the Kazakh language. Therefore, one part of me really wanted a promotion, and the other was wary of not being able to cope with the task. After all, if I move to another city, I will not be able to return to Karaganda to the position that I held in this company, since another employee will take my place. Working as a supervisor in Karaganda, I did the work that I had established and put on stream over several years, and it was relatively easy for me. I came to work with pleasure and received a stable income. In general, I was in a comfort zone. It was very difficult for me to make a decision to give up my comfort zone and live in my hometown, where many friends and acquaintances live, as opposed to career growth with a move to another city.",
          "The difficult decision was whether to accept the internal job transfer. It happened three months ago. Our department had a new project team to be formed, and the leader talked to me and said that he wanted to transfer me there. The people involved were mainly me, the department leader, and the person in charge of the new project. At that time, the department leader told me that the new project team was the focus of the company and had a good development prospect, but the work intensity would be much greater than it is now, and it would require frequent business trips. The person in charge of the new project team also described his future plans to me, saying that if he did well, there would be more opportunities for promotion. But I am already very familiar with the work at hand, and I have accumulated certain resources. Moreover, my child is still very young, and if I travel frequently, I really can't take care of my family. I was particularly entangled at the time. On the one hand, I didn't want to miss this opportunity that might help my career advance, and on the other hand, I was worried that I couldn't take care of my family. First, there is the dilemma of career development. If I stay in my current position, the work is easy but the promotion space is limited. If I go to a new project team, there are challenges and opportunities, but if I don’t make achievements, it may affect my current job. Secondly, there is the issue of balancing family and work. If I am often on business trips, there will be no one to take care of the elderly and children at home, and my wife is also very busy at work. I can’t rest assured that I will put all the burden of the family on her. Moreover, the new position requires exposure to new business and requires relearning a lot of things. If I don’t learn well, I will be passive at work. By then, I will not be able to take care of both my career and family, which will be very troublesome.",

          "Difficult decision: whether to accept the job offer to be assigned to Africa Time: December 2024 Location: Beijing (current residence) and Lagos, Nigeria (assignment location) Involved people: me (28 years old, engineer), girlfriend, project manager, HR Background: I have worked as a structural engineer for a Beijing infrastructure company for three years, responsible for domestic projects. In early December 2024, the company launched a cross-border railway project in Africa and nominated me as the on-site technical leader for a 2-year assignment. I was promised to be promoted to project supervisor and enjoy overseas allowances (double salary + full reimbursement of family air tickets). At the same time, my girlfriend is preparing a startup company in Beijing (in the field of environmental protection technology) and plans to land the first project in the first half of 2025. We were originally scheduled to get engaged in May 2025. Key conflicts and details: The game between career development and emotional stability: The project manager emphasized: \"This is the first time the company has participated in large-scale infrastructure in Africa, and I will directly enter the management after returning home\"; HR reminded that \"colleagues competing for promotion at the same time have priority if they have overseas experience.\" My girlfriend's startup project requires full investment in the early stage. If I am assigned overseas, she will have to deal with financing and team building alone, and a cross-border relationship may increase emotional risks (she has psychological trauma because her ex-boyfriend cheated on her in a different place). Real risks and family pressure: The security situation in Nigeria is complicated (the company requires overseas personnel not to go out after 22:00), and medical resources are limited (malaria and dengue fever are prevalent). After learning about it, my parents called every day to dissuade me, worried that \"I made money but lost my health.\" The assignment contract stipulates that \"you are not allowed to return to the country without authorization during the period, and special circumstances require approval from the headquarters.\" My girlfriend's grandfather is seriously ill, and she is afraid that \"if you are not around when your relatives pass away, we will all regret it.\" Fatal conflict of timeline: The company requires the signing of the assignment agreement within 3 days (passport renewal and vaccination must be handled simultaneously), and my girlfriend's startup project financing negotiations are scheduled in the same week, and she hopes that I will accompany her to attend key meetings (the potential investor is my industry senior). Private calculation: If I give up the overseas assignment, the probability of promotion in the next three years will drop from 70% to 40%; if I choose to be assigned overseas, the engagement date will need to be postponed, and I may miss the key support from my girlfriend in the early stage of entrepreneurship. Struggles in the decision-making process: Using the \"career life cycle model\" to evaluate: 28 years old is the golden period for accumulating technical experience. Overseas projects can be exposed to cross-border collaboration and complex geological processing technologies that are scarce in China, but the emotional relationship may enter a \"high-risk fluctuation period\". \"Hypothesis deduction\" with my girlfriend: If I stay: I can accompany her at any time when she encounters setbacks in her entrepreneurship, but I am worried that she will feel that \"I sacrificed career opportunities for you\" and incur emotional debt in the future. If I am assigned overseas: The monthly video communication budget will increase from 200 yuan to 800 yuan (Africa's network is unstable and requires a dedicated line), but I am afraid that time and distance will dilute trust. I consulted with a senior who had worked in Africa, and he sent me a photo of the construction site at 3 a.m.: \"You can save enough for the down payment in Beijing in 3 years here, but my phone is full of tickets for my girlfriend to watch movies alone.\" Final decision: On the eve of the signing of the agreement, I applied to the company to \"retain the promotion qualification and postpone the overseas assignment until 2026\", on the grounds that \"my fiancée needs to deal with risks together during the critical period of entrepreneurship.\" Core considerations: Compared with my girlfriend's entrepreneurial success rate (about 35% according to industry analysis) and my future overseas assignment opportunities (the company plans to continue to expand its African business within 5 years), the former is more time-effective. My parents suggested that \"I can temporarily borrow 200,000 to support my girlfriend's entrepreneurship\", which alleviated her financial pressure and also convinced me that \"family support can reduce the risk of staying in Beijing.\" Conflict between career advancement and emotional stability: Being assigned abroad can accelerate promotion, but the risk of a foreign relationship is high, and the girlfriend needs support in starting a business. Safety and health risks: The medical conditions in the place of assignment are poor, the public security risk is high, and the parents are very worried. Timeline squeeze: The company requires signing within 3 days, which overlaps with the girlfriend's critical period for entrepreneurship financing. Game between family responsibilities and personal ideals: The girlfriend's relatives are seriously ill and need to accompany her, but the career opportunity may be \"too late\". Uncertainty in the future: Staying in Beijing is afraid of missing out on overseas gilding, and being assigned abroad is afraid of emotional changes or business failure.",

Because I had talked to other colleagues before and found that I could do housework well, I originally refused, but the leader said that his daughter was going to get engaged, which made others worried (I guess no one was willing to do it during this off-season). I couldn't do it once and couldn't refuse, so I had to bite the bullet and accepted it. I can ask for money, but recently the performance evaluation is much more than the salary for work; I don’t ask, after all, it’s not done by me alone, so I don’t care about it personally, but I have paid every penny to my partners. If I don’t ask, I’m afraid that the boss will forget it, and if I say it, I’m afraid that it will affect my performance salary.",
          "Difficult decision: whether to accept a promotion opportunity in a different place Time: March 2025 Location: Shanghai (current residence) and Shenzhen (location of new position) Involved people: me (working person), spouse, direct supervisor, headhunter Background: I have been a product manager in an Internet company in Shanghai for three years, responsible for the core business line, with a harmonious team atmosphere, and my spouse has a stable job in Shanghai. In early March 2025, a leading company in Shenzhen contacted me through a headhunter and offered me a senior product manager position with a 40% salary increase and access to cutting-edge technology projects. After learning about it, my direct supervisor promised that if I stayed, I could participate in the management position competition for the company's new business line within half a year. Key conflicts and details: Trade-offs at the family level: My spouse's job in Shanghai is in a professional field, and changing cities may cause his or her career development to stagnate. Both parents are in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and Shanghai is closer to home. If I go to Shenzhen, I will have to live in a different place for at least 1-2 years, or persuade my spouse to resign and move with me, but she is uncertain about the job opportunities in the new city and feels anxious. Game of career development: The existing company platform is stable, but business growth has entered a bottleneck period, and there is uncertainty in the competition for management positions (there are other competitors in the team). Although the Shenzhen company is the industry leader, the new position needs to build a team from scratch, which is stressful and there is a risk of probationary period assessment (the contract stipulates a 6-month probationary period, and if the assessment fails, part of the resettlement fee must be compensated). Pull of realistic factors: I have rented a house in Shanghai for 3 years and have a fixed living circle; Shenzhen positions provide housing subsidies, but I need to re-adapt to high housing prices and fast pace. The headhunter emphasized that \"the window of opportunity is only 2 weeks\", and the current leader hopes that I will give my intention to participate in the competition within a week. The timeline conflict between the two sides leads to a sudden increase in decision-making pressure. Struggle in the decision-making process: Using the SWOT analysis method to compare the advantages and disadvantages of the two places, it is found that career growth (Shenzhen) and family stability (Shanghai) are difficult to have at the same time. After two weeks of in-depth communication with my spouse every night, she gradually changed from her initial opposition to \"If you decide to go, I can try to work remotely\", but there was still obvious concern in her tone. I consulted with industry seniors, some of whom suggested \"striving for a career while you are young\", and some reminded that \"the hidden cost of long-distance marriage may be underestimated\". Final decision: One day before the deadline, I declined the offer from Shenzhen and chose to stay in Shanghai to participate in the management position competition. The core reason is that I realized that family stability is more important to me at this stage, and the business accumulation of the existing team has not yet been fully transformed into personal competitiveness. Blind job hopping may increase risks. Subsequent impact: My spouse was relieved by my choice, and we began to plan to buy a house in Shanghai. We have entered the final interview stage of the management position competition. At the same time, we continue to pay attention to industry trends. We plan to consider mobility between first-tier cities after accumulating enough experience in 1-2 years. Family and career conflict: Spouse career development risk + possible long-term separation due to separation. Uncertainty of existing opportunities: Competition for management positions in the original company is competitive, and the result is unknown. High risk of new opportunities: Shenzhen positions have strict probationary period assessments, and failure requires compensation for resettlement expenses. Time pressure: The deadlines of the two opportunities conflict, and quick decisions are required. Cost of living and adaptation: The cost of relocating to Shenzhen is high, and adaptation to the new environment is required.",

The relocation meant that my husband needed to resign and the child needed to transfer to another school. During the discussion, although my husband supported this opportunity, he was worried about the changes and the child would resist leaving. I was caught in the dilemma of career breakthrough and family balance and stability. I encountered time issues as the company only gave me seven days to reply. Then there was the issue of my child's education. I was not familiar with the educational resources in Guangzhou and could not transfer to another school smoothly.

          "The most difficult decision: whether to quit public office to take care of my father with ALS Time: August 2019 Location: Chongqing home and district government office People involved: me (32 years old, the only child in a single-parent family), my father, my aunt (my father's sister), and my unit leader Background: I have been a civil servant in a district government in Chongqing for 8 years. My job is stable and recognized by my family. At the end of 2018, my father was diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). He was able to move well in the early stage. My aunt took care of him during the day and I accompanied him at night. In July 2019, my aunt had a sudden cerebral infarction and was hospitalized. My father's condition deteriorated rapidly. He could no longer eat or turn over on his own and needed 24-hour special care. Key contradictions: Career level: The unit is preparing for the public announcement of my promotion to section chief (the youngest candidate for section-level cadres in the district), and the leader hinted that \"taking leave at this time may affect the development in the next ten years\"; Family level: My father was a middle school teacher. He sold his old house to support my studies and raised me to adulthood. After the onset of the disease, he repeatedly used his eyes to signal that he \"did not want to drag me down\", but the cost of hospital nursing was as high as 6,000 yuan/month (more than half of my monthly salary), and no reliable candidates could be found. Outbreak event: In the early morning of August 5, 2019, I worked overtime until the early morning and went home. I found that my father fell off the bed and his mouth was broken and bleeding. He was afraid of disturbing my work on the phone, so he struggled alone for half an hour without calling for help. When I carried him back to bed, tears fell from the corners of his eyes and his throat made a vague \"go\" (suspected to ask me to \"go to work\"), and at that moment I realized: career promotion can be repeated, but my father's life is in countdown. Struggle in the decision-making process: The tear between ethics and reality: After being discharged from the hospital, my aunt advised me: \"Your father has been strong all his life. He will be more sad if he knows that he is dragging you down. It is better to hire a professional caregiver, don't resign.\" My colleague said privately: \"You have a high degree and strong ability. It is almost impossible for you to take the civil service exam after resigning. The competition outside the system is so cruel.\" Economic pressure calculation: There is no fixed income after resigning, and all savings (120,000 yuan) need to be used, and the cost of my father's follow-up treatment (such as ventilator, nutrition injection) is unpredictable; Tried to apply for public welfare nursing subsidies, but the process is long and cannot solve the urgent problem in the short term. Self-identity crisis: I used to be proud of my identity as a \"civil servant\". I was worried that I would lose the social label after resigning and become a \"full-time caregiver\" and be talked about by relatives and friends; When I was writing a resignation letter in the study late at night, I stared at the \"Excellent Civil Servant\" award on the wall in a daze, and my hands were shaking so much that the pen tip broke three times. Final decision: Submitted resignation report on August 12, 2019, giving up promotion opportunities. Core actions: Career separation: confessed family difficulties to the leader, and the leader approved \"1 year of unpaid leave\" (special care policy within the system), leaving the possibility of reinstatement in the future; Reconstruction of nursing plan: turned down all social visitors from my father, converted the bedroom into a nursing room, purchased medical beds, suction machines and other equipment, participated in the \"family care training\" organized by the community, and learned skills such as nasogastric feeding, turning over and patting the back, and catheterization; Psychological construction: Tell my father before going to bed every day: \"You raised me up, I will accompany you to grow old, this is my choice, not a sacrifice.\" Although he couldn't respond, I later found that he had hidden my childhood award certificate under his pillow. Career development conflict: Giving up promotion opportunities may lead to loss of career prospects within the system, and there is uncertainty in taking unpaid leave. Economic pressure: No fixed income after resignation, high cost of treatment and care for father, limited savings. Family conflict: Aunt does not support resignation, thinking it will make father feel guilty, and relatives and friends have different opinions. Social recognition anxiety: Worry about losing the social label brought by the civil servant status after resignation and being talked about by others. Self-doubt: Unsure whether resigning to take care of father is the right choice, afraid of regret in the future.",
          "Difficult decision: whether to quit my job as a teacher in my hometown and go to Guangzhou to make a living Time: Spring 2019 Location: A middle school office in Wuzhou, Guangxi, and a job-hunting apartment in Tianhe District, Guangzhou Participants: Me (28 years old at the time, a middle school Chinese teacher), parents, boyfriend (now husband, a long-distance relationship at the time) Detailed background and experience I have been a middle school teacher in my hometown of Wuzhou for 5 years. My job is stable and my parents are proud of me. I have been in love with my boyfriend who works in Guangzhou for 3 years and face the pressure of getting married. At the beginning of 2019, my boyfriend's company planned to form a new team. He hoped that I would quit my job and go to Guangzhou to end the long-distance relationship and prepare for the wedding together. At the same time, the school just promoted me to the deputy leader of the lesson preparation group and promised to let me lead the key class in the next school year - this is the interim result of my years of hard work. During that time, I would be in a daze every day when I was correcting homework in the office, looking at the familiar playground outside the window, thinking of the students shouting \"Hello, teacher\", and my heart was full of reluctance. After hearing the news, my parents rushed to the school overnight. My mother cried and said, \"You have never left Wuzhou since you were a child. You are so far away and you are unfamiliar with the place. What if you suffer a loss?\" My father sighed, \"We asked someone to help you buy a small house in the city. Do you have to live in a rental house?\" My boyfriend repeatedly said on the phone, \"There are many opportunities in Guangzhou. You can take the exam or do self-media. It's better than living in a small city where you can't see the end at a glance.\" I went to Guangzhou alone on the weekend and lived in the urban village apartment rented by my boyfriend. Every day I squeezed into the subway to interview the training institution. Looking at the people rushing around, I felt like an intruder. One evening, I passed by a middle school in Zhujiang New Town and saw students taking evening self-study through the fence. Suddenly I remembered that the third-year junior high school students I taught were preparing for the high school entrance examination. Tears fell all of a sudden - at that moment, I yearned for the possibilities of the big city, but was overwhelmed by a strong sense of separation. Fear of career gap Teacher recruitment in Wuzhou is a \"iron rice bowl\". If I fail the recruitment exam in Guangzhou after resigning, I may face the dilemma of \"30 years old + no stable job\"; the uncertainty of the self-media industry is too great, and I have no experience at all, so I am worried about becoming an \"old unemployed youth\". Example: When interviewing an educational institution, the HR said bluntly: \"You have been in a small city for a long time, and you may not be able to adapt to the fast pace of Guangzhou.\" This sentence made me sleepless all night. Family emotional tearing My parents think that I am rebellious for \"abandoning a stable life to take risks\" and began to ask relatives to introduce local blind dates; my boyfriend thinks I am \"not decisive enough\" and complains that long-distance relationships consume too much of his energy. Both sides are the people I care about the most, but they are in opposition because of my choice. Conflict scene: My mother secretly hid my resignation report. I searched through the bookcases at home but couldn't find it. I was so anxious that I had a big fight with her, and then hid in the room and cried. Confusion of identity In Wuzhou, I am \"Teacher Chen\" respected by students, and parents will greet me at any time when I walk on the street; in Guangzhou, I am just \"Xiao Chen\" whose resumes have been ignored, and I have few interview opportunities. This gap makes me doubt: \"Is it really worth giving up the existing social identity and starting from scratch?\" Economic pressure is concrete In Wuzhou, the monthly salary is 5,000+, and my parents subsidize the rent, so I can save 3,000 per month; in Guangzhou, the monthly rent is 2,500 (single room in a village in the city). There is no income during the interview period, and the savings are reduced like running water. I even calculated: If I can't find a job within 3 months, I must return to my hometown. The game between dignity and reality is played out in my heart every day.",
          "About three years ago, I faced an extremely difficult decision - whether to accept an assignment to work in a foreign branch. At that time, I was working as a middle-level manager at the headquarters of a large company. I had a stable job, a harmonious team atmosphere, and was at the stage of talking about marriage with my girlfriend who I had been in love with for many years. ​ It happened in the summer of that year. The company's senior management suddenly talked to me and said that the Southeast Asian branch was in a critical period of business expansion and urgently needed experienced managers. In view of my past work performance, I was hoped that I could go there to serve as the person in charge. The salary and benefits would be greatly increased, and the promotion space would also be considerable. It was a rare career development opportunity. After the news spread, my family and colleagues all participated in this matter. When my parents learned about it, they firmly opposed it. They felt that I had developed well in China. Going abroad was not only far from home, but they were old and worried that I would not be able to take care of them in time when they were sick. My girlfriend was also very hesitant. She had a stable job and social circle in the local area. She was worried that a foreign relationship would affect our relationship and that our future was full of uncertainty. When I was making the decision, I was in a dilemma. On the one hand, from a career perspective, I was eager to accept the challenge and prove myself on a broader platform, but this meant giving up my current stable life, starting all over again, and facing an unfamiliar culture and work environment; on the other hand, I couldn't let go of my family and girlfriend, didn't want to worry my parents, and was afraid of losing love. During that time, I often suffered from insomnia and couldn't concentrate at work during the day. I kept wavering between the two choices and didn't know how to balance family and career. This decision made me suffer.",

I still took my child to clubs and kindergarten, but in the evenings I could no longer stand on my feet. I felt like I was betraying my child by not prioritizing him. But after working for almost a decade in one place without much advancement, I saw this as an ideal chance to develop myself. I thought that if I earned enough and had a high position, I would be able to give my child a better future than we had initially. Now everything is getting better.

For the blunder during the organization of the conference, I was called a donkey in front of all the employees. I couldn't stand it, I left. It was the hardest decision. The problem was where to go as a single mother, there was no work, everywhere was asking for money, I needed acquaintances. When I left work, the institution never asked me to fill out a leave form, the management deliberately introduced it when I left, and the fact that someone was brought in to replace me before I left was a big problem."

          "My dad asked me if I would continue to run the family business in my name after he had passed on. I don't really have enough knowledge in this area so did not feel comfortable doing so. The reason he asked me to do this is because both of my brothers (who do work in the same line of work as my dad) both went bankrupt because of poor financial decisions and were banned from running businesses. So, they want to use my credit rating to run a family business. but provide my brothers with employment, despite me having my own career separate to them. It was made clear to me that without my 'help' in this matter, both of my brothers would face bleak financial futures and I felt enormous pressure to agree to something I did not feel comfortable with. Mainly the guilt and pressure coming from my own family. The idea that I was selfish if I didn't agree to this. My brothers have never really liked me or have bothered with me, and now they think I might be the only person who could give them secure employment after my dad's retires they are suddenly a lot friendlier towards me – and I hate the false flattery. But I know seep down that if I were to do this, both of my brothers would be as financially irresponsible as they have ever been and I could end up financially ruined because of their recklessness.",

We had a fight and he left. He was not home for 3 days. I called all my friends, the police. After the police searched, they found him. He was with a friend whom I also called. After 3 days of disappearance, he came and I accidentally found out from the taxi driver to whom he had pawned the phone that he was with a woman at the apartment of that same friend who told me he did not know where he was. He swore to me that nothing had happened. But then the facts came to light. It was difficult for me to forgive him because at the beginning of the relationship I warned him that lies and cheating were the two things I would not forgive. the problem was that i went on maternity leave. we just rented an apartment. the birth of a child was a new stage in our relationship. and it was hard for me to decide whether i wanted to continue living with this person",

I had to decide whether I would fight for him or let him go. I let him go and made it easy for him to leave, staying civil and keeping the family home to be able to look after our children, even though I can only just afford to stay in it. I had to withstand all sorts of gaslighting from him, not reacting when he said it was all my fault, that the children didn't like me, that I wasn't able to look after the house, etc, etc, etc. I stayed civil, even looking after him, when he broke up with her for 2 weeks, and came home. I behaved honourably throughout, despite him abandoning the children. I told them that he would come back to them - although it hasn't happened yet! He attacked and attacked, and I withstood it all, in order to be the better person and look after the children, not saying one thing that I couldn't defend later - it was so hard!",

This person was my wife's sister, she would constantly come to sit at my house 1 month ago, and I kept my distance from her in a sweet way without letting her know. Because her constant comings and goings were negatively affecting us, I could not spend time with my nuclear family. When my sister-in-law first talked sweetly to me and made excuses like I had work to do and could come back another time, she didn't care and continued to stay at my house, so I didn't let her know anymore, when she came, I took my daughter and went out, and when she left, I went back into my house.",

It was not true, but nevertheless I was branded as guilty and the atmosphere in the house worsened. I really wanted to move out, but I couldn't because there was no money for rent. I felt very bad and uncomfortable, even worse than before this situation. I couldn't work because of my studies. I came across the fact that it turns out that there are such inadequate people/families, and that these are my relatives... also with a strong deterioration in mental health, with financial problems.",
          "I chose to go no-contact with my father a few years after leaving home. He did not self-reflect or change much after my sister and I moved away, and the final straw came when he stalked and harassed my mother, who had gone on vacation with her mother to another country. He followed her to the airport, but she left anyway (and would come back).  Then, coming back to town, he ran into myself, my sister, and our partners at a favorite restaurant. He stood outside the door, then left. Later he told my mother that we were meeting to plot against him (we were simply eating lunch).  His treatment of my mother, my discomfort with his behavior throughout my life, and his inability to self-reflect or feel genuine remorse (nothing he does is wrong or misguided) led me to write him that I was ceasing contact. He is my parent, so there was a little guilt. However, I mostly wrestled with the grief of knowing we did not and would not have a real relationship where he treated me with respect, or listened to anything I had to say.  Ceasing contact with him has also limited contact with my mother, who was no longer able to visit me, or I her.  I was not able to visit the family home for holidays any longer, or see my pets before they passed.  He continued to harrass me and grew increasingly accusatory and delusional.",
          "The most difficult decision I've ever had to make was about whether to falsely assume responsibility for a crime I did not commit in order to protect someone I loved very much. The situation involved myself, the married woman I was having an affair with, and her family (who were close friends of mine). At the time, I was living with this woman and her family, and I had recently begun to see that she was - and had been for a very long time - living in a very abusive marriage. Her oldest son was regularly using the internet to download very questionable pornographic material. The crime in question was possession of child pornography. I knew that it was either her oldest son, or the neighbor across the street who was a sex offender and had access to our Wi-Fi. The caveat in the situation was that I had a prior conviction for the same crime in question once before; therefore, the legal consequences of assuming responsibility would be much more severe than if I hadn't already had a strike against me. I was under suspicion for the crime because the internet account for the whole house was in my name, but I knew that I had not been the one to do it, and it had to be either the neighbor or the woman's son, and I could have very easily proved myself innocent. The problem was that I was completely in love with her, and I knew that if I pointed out the likely culprits it would at the very least expose the affair and potentially lead to her son's imprisonment. I didn't care about the neighbor at all, but I couldn't say either way which one it was.",

At the same time, I had a job interview in another city for a job that I was very interested in. There was no way to reschedule the interview. So the choice was either to help my brother and lose the chance for my dream job or to get a job but to refuse my brother in an important matter. I chose my brother. A dilemma caused by a conflict of interests - what is more important to me - family or private interest. I don't care much about the opinions of others, but it is important for me to be in harmony with my choices.",

          "The most difficult decision I had to make was cutting off contact with my Dad. It was ten years ago and it was at a time where I was really struggling mentally and he kept making fun of my anxiety amongst other things. The breaking point for me was when my younger sister had told me that when she was around his house, he and his wife had been making fun of me, my dad had said that he should pretend to be ill and claim benefits and his wife said he had to dribble more. It was at this point I messaged him and explained how narcissistic and unsupportive he had been and I haven’t spoken to him since. There was a bit of resentment from my siblings, my dad played the victim and said how awful I was for the way I had spoken to him. His wife had messaged me saying that my dad is the most perfect dad that I could possibly have but it didn’t matter because he had another son from a previous marriage that he liked more. My brother believed I had been awful to him and tried to get me to apologise so it did cause a bit of tension.",

          "Sometimes the hardest decision is to take a step into the unknown. For me, that step was divorce. With two children, without confidence in the future, under the pressure of opinions that \"children need a father.\" But in the end, I realized: children need not just a father, but peace, respect and love in the home. And I chose a difficult but honest path - the path to freedom. I faced the following problems: - Pressure from relatives, \"what kind of father do children need,\" they kept saying. - Finding a lawyer who really knows all the nuances of dividing property turned out to be almost impossible. Many asked for a lot of money, promising certainty, but at the same time could not give any guarantees. I almost lost a large sum during the division of property - due to the ignorance or negligence of the lawyer. - Defenselessness. My ex-husband was a domestic tyrant. I lived and live in constant fear - for myself, for my children. When I tried to ask for help - I went to the local police officer - they refused to accept my application. They behaved indifferently, as if it was none of their business. Only after I filed a complaint about their inaction via e-mail, they began to react somehow. It was humiliating to feel that even the system, which should do so by law, does not protect you.",
          "This decision concerned the end of my toxic 2.5-year relationship.  It concerned me, my then-boyfriend, his mother and my closest friend.  It took place between February and August 2022.  My boyfriend abused me extremely mentally, occasionally physically and regularly sexually.  My then-boyfriend abruptly broke up with me wanting to switch to \"friendship\". At my request, we simply changed it to \"break\". It turned out that he already had a new partner at that time... It was our mutual friend who I personally introduced him to.  Although he was in a relationship with her, he harassed me, sexually provoked me and manipulated me to have sex despite my sexual blockages, which were created by many rapes and molestations in the past. He also committed rape and attempted rape, as well as the aforementioned molestation. During the \"break\" they were giggling and cuddling behind my back... In the meantime I was in the same room in silent tears and with paralysis combined with panic attacks that even Xanax didn't help. Something similar to Stockholm syndrome developed in me. After the rape and another attempt by him, he began to be enslaved. To rationalize his actions. I wanted to talk about what was wrong, but month by month he wanted to cooperate less and even reacted with aggression to attempts at communication. Requests for him to go to a psychologist and a doctor, both mine and his mother's, did not work. What he should have treated, he took out on me. He called me names, humiliated me, made me feel complexed, scared... I was ruined. The relationship dissolved itself, but the decision remained what to do next. Because of the syndrome I was unable to free myself, and despite the relationship he was using me. I tried to set a boundary explaining that he would not let me fall out of love by doing this. He stopped for a moment, but then he repeated it, which was already blatant harassment without remorse.  My body did not cooperate despite the willingness to make a decision, my mental state and Stockholm syndrome blocked my options. It was getting worse and worse... I was afraid every day and every day I wanted to die. I no longer saw any sense in anything. It dragged on for months. I felt like a prisoner. Due to the prolonged decisions and helplessness, I had to stop my studies and take a health dean's degree. I was unable to function normally. They also planned to fire me from my job. They abused me there.  My friend Dawid came to help... An idiot who moved to Krakow out of love to save me from myself, when he was later facing rejection, because he was not my type and I did not feel that our personalities were a good match. Despite this, he came, settled here and saved me... not yet knowing that rejection was waiting for him. He did not even tell me! I only found out after the fact and I felt so guilty...  My condition made him do something like that in emotion.  Without him I can say that I would most likely not be alive.  He helped me make the decision to close this chapter and move to survive...  Without him this decision would not have come to fruition, but my life would. Problems with self-esteem and self-confidence. Problems with a deteriorating psyche. Disturbances in my verdict due to an ex-boyfriend who manipulated and molested me. Helplessness. Financial and educational problems. Conflict in the relationship. Lies and slander. Lack of support from most of the environment. Problems with work. Emotional disorders. Adjusting psychotropic drugs (I had a very hard time with it). Describing it made me a bit sad, so I have a problem with citing more.",

I took him to my house and when we got there, he asked to go back to his mother's house. My current wife and I drove back about 40km and left him back without any explanation. This left me very frustrated, because I had just come out of a serious five-day hospital stay and I just wanted to spend some time with my son. I kept thinking about why that happened, if he was alienated by his mother, or if his love for me had cooled, I am very distressed about the situation, because I don't know when I will be able to see him again.",

The situation at home got complicated, there was a lot of stress and I simply could not give him as much attention and time as he needed. I thought about it for weeks, I even cried a few times because I loved him so much. Finally, I found him a new home with friends in the countryside, where he has a garden and a lot of freedom. It still hurts me a bit, but I know it was for his own good. I visit him once every two weeks, he was with us for almost 8 years, I know he can come back to us, but it will be hard to allocate a part of the apartment for him. The biggest problem was the guilt and fear of letting him down. The dog was like a family member to us. I wondered if I was really doing this for his good, or if I was just trying to escape responsibility and using the change of environment as an excuse. I also had doubts whether his new family would take good care of him – even though I knew them before, it wasn’t the same as me.",

Because I had to pay the mortgage, pay off debts, there was simply no other way out. Every day I went to work thinking: \"What if I betray him?\" Maybe this will become a psychological trauma for him, because he could not fall asleep without me, he could not even go to the potty on his own.

The problems are more psychological and moral... pressure from relatives and a feeling of guilt and regret that I couldn’t help and damaged relationships with certain relatives."

          "I was in the transition period from middle school to high school. I was enrolled in a boys' high school and I was torn between whether to go or not, and because of this, one year of my life was wasted. I spent 1 year at home, so 1 year was wasted.",
          "I decided to get a job without going to campus, even though I passed my high school with distinction. Due to the economic problems at home, I had to make this decision, albeit reluctantly. This year this happened. The fact that there is no one to spend money to study further and severe financial difficulties at home",
          "Entering university after school. I categorically did not want this, I planned to do nails, I studied, I was really good at it. But the head of the family was my grandmother with the attitude from the USSR that higher education is a must. In the end, I took the documents to the university, studied for a year and a half and just stopped going. I did not like anything there. Not the student life, but the education in general. Some teachers said that we were not capable of anything, some told their life stories. And they paid money for this. In the end, I do not have a higher education, the desire to do nails was also discouraged. I didn't want it, there was a very strong internal resistance. I fell asleep during lectures. Every morning I persuaded myself to get up and get ready. In the end, it all turned into a huge scandal, I left home for several weeks, didn't go to university. I don't even want to imagine what was going on in my mother's head during that period. Now we have a wonderful relationship in the family, but deep down there is anger that I was not allowed to do what I liked.",
          "I graduated high school in mathematics, I failed the exam several times, at that time I was depressed, even thinking about it makes me sad. I didn't have anything to do, but my friend said that we should repeat high school in another subject, I thought for several days and decided to repeat high school in another subject. this event happened four or five years ago. I thought how to face financial problems, mental breakdowns, society ",
          "Go to an international conference to represent the university, but with your own resources I didn't have the financial resources at that time and the university didn't provide support.",
          "I graduated from university in May and failed the postgraduate entrance examination. My parents wanted me to return to my hometown and work in a public institution. The salary was stable and the work was boring. However, I didn't want to rely on the mediocrity given by my parents, so I decided to repeat the year and take the exam again. The support of my parents, the ridicule of passers-by, the cold eyes of relatives, the persuasion of colleagues to give up, and my own inner vacillation",
          "Although I was planning to do an advanced degree in biology, my average result was not as good as I expected. That's why I had to study commercial subjects for high school. It was very difficult for me to make up my mind to do commercial subjects. I went to biology classes until I got my results. But when I had to choose commerce subjects, it became very difficult. But I also thought that I would not be able to finish the general exam again.",
          "Several years ago, but after the Covid lockdown, I left the residency. Although it was in my city, but after spending 11 years studying, I still decided to interrupt my studies, as I did not feel that this profession suited me, there was burnout, anxiety. I faced the judgment of my relatives and fear for my financial well-being. Since I had no work experience due to my studies and, it seemed, no skills, and the scholarship for my studies made up half of my husband and I's income, it was a difficult decision.",
          "the decision concerned the choice of the field of study. I was in a mathematics and physics class, and in the last year I decided to study medicine. I did not have advanced biology or chemistry at school, I had to learn everything myself in less than a year. catching up on the material cost me a lot of work and a lot of stress many people advised me against this choice. I had no support from friends or family. I also had to prepare for the final exams in other subjects, I didn't know how to plan this time",
          "My hardest decision so far was 5 years ago. What direction do I want to take after high school, continue my education or look for a job that would allow me to develop my interests and profession. My family would advise me to continue my education, but they didn't pressure me. However, I was of the opinion that I could do part-time studies in the meantime. I chose work, but I didn't abandon my plans for further education, but I haven't started it yet. Internal dilemmas, whether I will have time for this education, whether it is not too early to devote myself fully to work, whether it is the right time to enter adulthood.",
          "I was accepted into two different federal universities — Pharmacy at UFSC and Radiology at IFSC — and I was genuinely interested in both, which made the decision really difficult. I talked it over with my parents and with my aunt, who has a degree in Radiology. When I found out I had passed, I was at home — it was early in the year. Everything felt a bit confusing because, at the same time, I was deeply saddened by the passing of my cat. I finished high school later than usual, so I was afraid of choosing a college program I wouldn’t connect with — and ending up wasting even more time in my life.",
          "It was a difficult decision to give up my dream studies, and constantly force myself to continue looking for a job when I had been unable to find one for almost three months after being fired, no answers, and money was running out, and to fight off suicidal thoughts that were becoming more frequent. It happened at the turn of December and January 2025, I sent about 150 CVs, to which I received no answers, and I slowly began to lose hope, I was threatened with homelessness, so I had to cut costs, I fell for my dream studies... At the very beginning I tried to stay in these studies without paying. I thought I would find a job in a month. Ironically, it didn't work out, so after another month, in order to reduce the debt to the university, I had to resign from part-time studies because I simply couldn't afford them anymore. My dream was to get a master's degree, I was in my last year, unfortunately this dream was ruined/was postponed a lot in time",
          "While studying a diploma course related to agriculture at Dambulla College of Agriculture, I received a letter for university. I had to decide whether to continue the course I was studying or to go to the Faculty of Science. there I decided to continue studying the course I was studying. He was studying in the course for many months, and having to drop out or having to drop out in order to drop out of the Faculty of Science was the biggest problem that came up.",
          "The hardest decision I had to make was to decide whether I was going to drop out of my university or change majors. During this situation, I had my parents support me and give me emotional support and were willing to support me regardless of my decision. This took place during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and during this time, all of my classes were held online and I was taking 5 classes, 4 of which were STEM classes, followed by their own tutorials. Some specific issues I encountered were weighing the pros and cons of switching or dropping out. In addition, I was also looking at my current grades and weighing the chances of me being accepted to switch into a different program or get admission to a new university.",
          "My most difficult decision in life was a few years ago. I had a dilemma whether I should finish high school or not (for adults). I was close to passing, but the only subject I had problems with was math. I only needed to pass 1 exam in this subject, but I failed every time. During this decision I had thoughts like what my family would think, if I would find a job in the future, who would want to hire someone without a degree... But I felt that high school was not necessary for me considering my long-term goals. Especially since I did not even want to go to college.",
          "I resigned from my job as a university professor. I didn't like college because it was very mercenary and didn't value education very much. Politicking by the coordination and teachers in collusion with the culture of commercialized education",
          "The most difficult decision in my life was to take the postgraduate entrance examination. After graduating from university, I found a very good job with a high income and relatively harmonious interpersonal relationships in the company. However, I did not like the content of this job very much and was very confused for a while because I myself prefer computer science. After struggling for half a year, I decided to continue to take the postgraduate entrance examination. At that time, my family was against it. The most difficult problem is that I am a girl and I have already started working. If I want to continue my postgraduate studies, even if I can pass the exam successfully, I will be older after graduation and will face the pressure of finding a partner and having children, which makes me very conflicted. In addition, my family’s financial situation is not very good and my parents have already retired. It is a bit beyond their ability to continue to support me in my postgraduate studies.",
          "The hardest decision I've ever made was choosing what to study. I took the ICFES Saber tests, and my score wasn't what I expected, and I became quite depressed. I longed for a good score to have the freedom to choose, but now I was limited only by that score. Now, in my city, there's only one public university, so I had to settle for the majors offered there. I spent an entire day on the computer looking at the curriculum for each major, afraid of making a mistake in the future and not liking the major when I graduated, wasting my time for nothing. The problem was that I hadn't stopped to think about what I really wanted to do, in the future, and in the world of work. I'd been under that pressure since the beginning of my last year of school, and now I had to face it once and for all. I was also afraid of disappointing everyone, of choosing a career that had no job prospects.",
          "I was forced to abandon my university studies. At a very young age, I dropped out of medical school at the Universidad del Norte. My fear of public speaking led me to isolate myself and become obsessed with a single subject, so I stopped attending the rest of my classes. I failed many classes, and it was impossible to make up for the semester. I sought psychiatric help from one of my professors, and he mocked my clinical condition, arguing that it was all my own invention. The university welfare department completely ignored me. My family thought it was all my own invention. They didn't support me during the most difficult time of my youth. I became filled with fear, and I also missed classes. I decided to drop out of college.",
          "This happened in my youth and it was connected with entering a higher educational institution. After finishing school I entered the institute, in the fee-paying department, but after studying for 1.5 years, my parents and I (even though I worked part-time) could not pay for my further education. I had to leave my studies. After that, every year, for almost 5 years, I still could not enter a university (on a grant). By the age of 22, no money, no education, no health. After that, complete apathy to everything arose. For quite a long period, I \"dropped out of life\". From a psychological point of view, the difficulty of my decision, probably, was that it cost me a considerable amount of precious time (for many months), before I realized that I needed to continue living and fighting despite the endless series of failures. Annual failures in admission. There were financial problems, there was not enough money even for the manuals and tests for admission. Those years, even people with higher education could not find a job, and if they did, it was poorly paid. Then serious health problems were added to them. It is clear that there was no talk of any personal life.",
          "dropping out of school, no one was involved except me, it was in the last year I had neurosis and depression at that time, which unfortunately led me in an unpredictable way to make this senseless decision",
          "When I graduated from college, I didn’t get into my favorite school and major because my postgraduate entrance exam scores were not ideal. I had to apply for transfer. Two schools sent me offers and I had to choose one of them. I was very confused and no one could enlighten me. It was really the darkest moment of my life. Because the majors of the two schools were not my forte, when I made the choice, I felt that I was not completely sure that I could pass it. I even thought about reviewing for a year if it didn't work out.",
          "It was a question of continuing my studies or taking up a job. It was 6 months ago when I was not sure if I was fit to study but I finally decided to continue my studies. The reason was that I had no idea what kind of job I could do that would not be a pain. Studying seemed better even though I am still not sure about it. The problem was and still is the lack of certainty of what I want to do in life. It is probably normal, but it is hard to accept. The second problem may have been the lack of time, because it limited me in terms of the optimal choice of studies. The third problem is the lack of my own money for independence.",
          "Quitting my studies and starting work I was studding for CA after 4 attempts i had to quit due to financial problem Financial and family medical health issues were there due to which i had to quit studies",
          "My toughest decision was whether to go back to school after getting out of the military. I’d served 12 years, and transitioning to civilian life wasn’t easy. I had savings and a GI Bill, but I was scared to be the oldest guy in class and worried I wouldn’t be able to keep up. Self-doubt was the biggest hurdle. I questioned whether I could keep up academically after being out of school for so long. I was also nervous about being older than most students and not fitting in. Financial stress was another issue, even with the GI Bill—it didn’t cover everything, and I didn’t want to put pressure on my wife. Balancing school and being a new dad added to the weight of the decision.",
          "My son applied to NIS and BiL schools last year and failed to get in, and this year he applied to a physics and mathematics school and failed to get in there either. So I made tough decisions for my son My son's indifference, lack of interest in anything, his focus on the process, not the outcome",
          "After the winter break, I stayed in school to work on my course project. I hadn’t finished it by the end of December. I was working alone in the dormitory. There were not many people in the whole school. It felt quite desolate. I couldn’t hold on for the last few days, so I decided to go home. Going home meant that I might not be able to submit it in time. Because I started late and didn’t work hard before, others had finished it while I was still working on it. Then I really couldn’t stay any longer. I felt very disappointed every day, but I was also worried that I wouldn’t be able to submit it if I went home. But in the end, I went home and chose to give up the opportunity to continue my studies. Very hesitant, the loss of being unable to make a decision, and the distress of time passing by so quickly",
          "<NA> <NA>",
          "I think it was about starting a master's degree, and I thought it would affect my process because I was working at KPSS, now called AGS. I have finished the first term and I am happy (my KPSS process was positively affected by this situation, contrary to what I thought). Actually, I can't say that I had a lot of difficulty, I just had a short internal examination, I preferred to live and see rather than regret.",
          "I dropped out of school and started e-commerce thanks to my friends in Ankara on January 28th. I had a hard time quitting school just before I graduated because all my hard work was going to be in vain.",

          "I suspended my university studies because I didn't have enough financial resources to cover the costs. stress, anxiety, physical illnesses.",
          "So far, I have made the decision whether to continue studying after failing the college entrance examination. I decided not to continue studying, but to go out into society to learn more skills and majors and work. At that time, my family asked me to think it over carefully, which happened at home on the two days after the college entrance examination results were released. Learn whatever skills you can to find a suitable, satisfying job and make money.",
          "the hardest decision was to apply for a master's degree. i felt tired after my bachelor's degree but my mother's arguments were better I think it's psychological and if you consider fatigue as physical, then the same. I had to think, should I or shouldn't I, should I or shouldn't I",
          "Should I continue my studies? I was self-involved and decided not to interrupt my studies, which was a good choice. There were many things for and against, but I had a big problem with energy at the time. Because of work and studies, I had no strength for anything and no motivation to do anything.",
          "Coming home without appearing for one subject due to illness in the high school exam hall. Not being at a level of health suitable for taking the exam.",
          "I graduated from biology department. then I went to training at the nursing college, and after about three months, I thought that I would leave it and go to science. So I had to decide whether to become a nurse or a teacher. After thinking a lot, I finally decided that I will leave the nursing school and go to the Faculty of Science to become a teacher. I had to pay money when I left the nursing school because I had not finished my training",
          "This decision was about continuing my master's degree a year ago. I got into a course that I thought I would like more or less, but after the first few classes I realized I was wrong. I went through a bachelor's degree in a similar course and felt like I was back to square one. The thought of going through the same thing for two more years really put me off. I wondered if I should give up and find something new next year or grit my teeth and do what had to be done. My mom and close friends helped me make the decision. I felt that these studies were not for me and I should have chosen something else, but I did not consider this before I started. Therefore, if I had dropped out of these studies, I would have been left with nothing. I had no backup plan. In addition, everyone I consulted told me the same thing - I should continue. My mother told me that if I took a break, I would never go back to studies. My friends thought that it couldn't be that bad and that I should give this course another chance. Unfortunately, with each piece of advice they gave me, I felt even worse.",
          "Had to choose about dropping a Course, talked to various seniors and it was my summer break great mental indecision and self doubt",
          "Entering college. In 2003, I didn't know where to go. A young guy, I didn't know how to live my life, what profession to choose. I was worried that I wouldn't get in. It was difficult to pass the entrance exams. There was a lack of study material. The deadlines for passing the exam were pressing.",
          "I come from a lower economy family, my father is a auto rickshaw driver. At 17 years of my age after completing my Intermediate, I asked my father to make me join in a UK based course (CIMA) for which I had to pay 1 Lakh INR just for 6 months as tution fee and 25k INR as exam fee. But due to no money and course being expensive my father declined it and asked me to some general degree and get going with life. But I seriously wanted to do that course, so I have joined a work at a hospital in which my sister was working as a nurse. I joined as a receptionist and pharmacy assistant which is a 12 hours shift job from evening 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM for 5K INR salary. And for which my father agreed and he paid half of the fee for my course and I paid the half of the fee. But after 1 year the institute owner who was providing the course have closed the institute and have disappeared abruptly. I couldn't contact him and there were only 15 students along with me taking that course and it's the first time such a turn around situation happened to my life that too I have worked very hard to earn the money and pay for that course. I was devastated and completely lost hope on studies. But somehow my parents have Consoled me and then I have joined degree. And also during my degree days I used to work as shopkeeper and Milk & paper delivery boy and used to earn money which then motivated me. Specific issue can be unlike the kids in Indian families, I felt very bad about our family economic situation and i have to work for my education during the very young age and it wasn't easy for me. I used only sleep 3-5 hrs a day. And I had to leave many of my interests like cricket, singing and my habit of playing Drums."

This decision involved evaluating whether to pursue the program in India or go abroad, as I had secured admission offers from reputed institutions in both geographies. Both colleges had equal reputation and both required similar amount of investment. The decision-making process took place last year and involved extensive discussion with my parents, who played a significant role in helping me weigh the financial, academic and professional implications of each option, keeping future in mind. While making this decision, I encountered several critical issues that added to the complexities. Firstly, I had to assess which college offered a better academic and professional ecosystem aligned with my long-term goals. Job opportunities post MBA, especially in consulting and operations, were a major concern, along with understanding where my future would have more potential to prosper- domestically or internationally.

My parents would take her to the vets on my behalf if I chose to. This happened in March 2025. We did go ahead and get her x-rayed and she took a few days to recover, I hated the fact she was away from home for too long that day. I had a lot of emotional issues, because she's my little baby, and I knew the risk involved in her having an x-ray, plus it was the very first time I've encountered something like this so it was quite nail-bitingly scary for me.

It happened about 6 years ago. Our dog Max was 9 years old and had been losing weight for some time. Of course, there were visits to the vet, x-rays, tests, medicines. Unfortunately, it turned out that he had some kind of stomach cancer and there was probably no way to save him. We had to decide whether to keep him alive with medicines and watch him suffer, or decide to put him to sleep. We decided, in consultation with the vet, that this would be the better decision for our beloved pet... Our hearts were breaking, but we didn't want him to continue to suffer and suffer. The decision was made, and with it a lot of tears. To this day, these are not easy memories. The biggest problem was the flood of thoughts and whether we were doing something wrong. We kept hoping that maybe our pet would recover, but the vet left no illusions. It was hard, but we had to make a decision.",

They couldn't figure out what caused it. It happened again two weeks later. My husband held him and he recovered in a half hour. It happened a couple days later and he never came out of it. He was lying on the floor, not in pain, but almost nonresponsive. We had someone come to the house to euthanize him in his comfortable and well known environment.

My partner and her veterinarian with also involved in the decision. She was having so much anxiety that there were situations in which she was having trouble functioning, and it was affecting sleep and quality of life for my partner and I, as well as our other dog. We ultimately chose the medication in hopes that it would help us all. We worried about side effects, and also about cost. In order to even get the medication prescribed, a full panel of bloodwork was required, which was $600 on its own. We ultimately decided it would be worth the costs and potential risks.",

In 2022, my 4-year-old cat became ill and stopped eating because of the many stressors where we lived at the time, causing her condition to deteriorate rapidly. I hospitalized her briefly, she received liver treatment at home for a few weeks, and she eventually died on the way to the emergency room. Treating her at home was a tremendous physical and emotional drain, but finances were tight. She had a lot of medication, and I had to give her something every two hours, in addition to food, because she still had no appetite. In her final days, she had a tube sticking out of her body to administer medication and wet food; it was exhausting. A veterinarian friend recommended I keep trying. She saw some inconsistencies in how she'd been evaluated at the vet at the time, and we decided to order some meds, which arrived about half an hour after she died. I saw her collapse, vomit, and convulse; it was heartbreaking. She died in my lap.",

He was a 15 year old black Labrador but his back legs where not working correct and he was starting to fall over a lot. His mind was perfect which was the hard part. My wife and I decided to take him to the vet to get him put to sleep. This all happened around 10 years ago. The dog was part of our family, we have no children so he was like a son to us. The problem was when we took him to the vets because of his age the vet could not find a vein as the where very narrow, it was traumatic for us and we vowed to never have another dog again. Eventually the vet did get the injection in and Ben went to sleep. After a few months we did get another dog, in fact we have three now.",
          "euthanize my dog. He was very sick, and we really did everything we could. He was suffering greatly, and my family and I had to make that difficult decision. The feeling of guilt, of nostalgia, of regret.",
          "I had to make the most difficult decision I have ever made in my life, which was to say an early goodbye to one of my beloved dogs after she became unexpectedly ill and was not expected to recover. The decision was made by me, my partner was there at the time and so was the vet. This decision took place at the emergency vet in a private room. We had spent a few days running tests and trying many treatments to no avail, which led to our decision to end her suffering. More than anything else, I was overcome with the grief of the entire situation. In some ways, the decision wasn't \"difficult\" in terms of knowing I didn't have any other options (the alternative was to let her suffer and die at a later point, possibly within a few hours) but the emotion weight of the decision was incredibly difficult for me to go through.",
          "I remember when my previous dog was very sick in 2022. He had been sick for a long time with many ailments, despite the medical care we sought for him and treatment he received, his quality of life was not improving to the point that it had been previously. Eventually, a decision was made, in conjunction with the vet, that he would be put to sleep as his quality of life was not adequate anymore. It was the hardest decision I've ever had to make, but I did not want him to suffer anymore. I still think about him every single day. I felt a loyalty towards him as he had been there for us, however, that loyalty also brought me to the point that I cared about him so much that I did not want him to suffer anymore.",
          "The difficult decision I had to make was whether to euthanize my pet chicken or not. The people who were involved were myself, the veterinarian, and his assistants. This situation took place at the veterinary clinic a few months ago. At the time, I had taken my pet chicken to the veterinarian to see if he could help her with her problem because she wasn't looking or feeling well and it was obvious to me. For one thing, I encountered moral issues. For example, I had to figure out if it was right or wrong to euthanize my pet. I also felt issues in relation to my personal feelings. For instance, I felt extreme sadness in considering euthanizing her. Besides this, I had to make sure I had enough money to pay for any problems she had so there were also financial issues.",
          "I had to decide if I was going to put down my cat or not. He was experiencing some kidney failure and I had to make the call if he should be put on medication, but remain in constant pain. I was faced with the dilemma of keeping an old friend alive, or to put him to rest in order to relieve him of his constant pain. This was difficult as I wasn't ready to part with a long standing companion.",
          "The decision was to put my dog to sleep, after months of fighting the disease I didn't have much choice. I could either soothe his suffering or hope for a miracle that probably wouldn't happen. It was my decision alone, others tried to advise me but I had to decide. It was hard for me to let my dog go, I knew that theoretically it was a better decision but in moments like these you rarely think objectively. Emotions played a big role",
          "If I want to tell you about an incident I experienced recently, I wanted to have a pet at home recently, but my family was very opposed to this situation. They asked me questions like, \"How can you take care of this animal? I don't think you can meet the needs of this animal. Can you take responsibility for this animal?\" And of course I said that I know that this animal is a living being and that I can do my best to take care of its needs and that I can meet its needs from my own budget. Despite this, they said things like \"You cannot take responsibility for this animal. You can hardly take care of yourself.\" And they demoralized me a little, but in the end I convinced them and adopted a pet. The problems I encountered regarding this decision were, firstly, my efforts to convince my family took a long time and this demoralized me. In addition, my friends and neighbors made negative comments and behaviors that demoralized me. However, I showed myself that I could take responsibility for this animal.",
          "Putting my dog to sleep. My whole family was involved, but I had the final decision, and the vet visit (this one and all the previous ones). This happened in the summer. The dog suddenly became moribund overnight, required an overnight vet visit, and ultimately I had the choice to either try to keep him alive or let him go. It was a very emotionally difficult decision for me. After months of trying to keep the dog comfortable, from one day to the next I had to decide to end his life. It was not a natural death, but a reduction in suffering. After all, deciding about someone's life and death, especially someone you have lived with for years and loved like a family member, is extremely difficult and you are not entirely sure if it is the right thing to do.",

          "The most difficult decision I've ever had to make was putting my dog Oscar to sleep. He had been struggling with his back legs for quite sometime, having undergone 2 operations to repair his damaged cruciate ligaments. Over the past year he had gotten progressively worse, struggling to get up, losing his balance and frequent urination in the house. I scheduled an appointment to have him euthanised.. My Mum an I were there to see him over the rainbow bridge. I'd never seen my Dad cry until that day. I really struggled with the decision as he still enjoyed his food and walks, but I could see how much pain he was in despite the medication.",
          "A few years ago my dog had some serious health issues and it looked like he wasn't going to make it. I was on the phone with my parents and we were wondering if we should put him down. On the one hand, I wanted to be able to say goodbye to the dog and wait to put him to sleep until I got to my parents, but on the other hand, it might have been an unnecessary prolongation of his suffering.",
          "I had to have my dog destroyed after he turned on a puppy I had had hime for 9 years and he had been suffering from a kind of canine dementia, something I hadn't heard of nor experienced previously. I had to make a quick decision as if I had waited I would have most likely have changed my mind I still regret it but know it was correct thing to do",
          "One of the hardest decisions of my life was to put my 18 year old cat to sleep. She was a picture of health but one day she was hit by a car. The surgery would have been very expensive and there was no telling whether it would work. The decision was mine alone, I had to make it at the vet in a few moments. The problem was money and chances of success.",
          "A few years ago - adopting a dog from a shelter - my girlfriend was in favor but I wasn't completely convinced. I wasn't convinced, I had doubts whether a dog from a shelter would have any behavioral problems, whether it would be too old, whether it would have any diseases, and the adoption process itself seemed to me that it would take a lot of time.",
          "The difficult decision was to take into my car an injured dog that my girlfriend and I found on the side of the road in a deserted forest area. I wondered what to do with the animal. On the one hand, we couldn't leave it there, on the other hand, it meant a huge responsibility and taking on the pressure related to the animal's condition.",
          "A couple of years ago, I had to give my neighbour's cat, who really became my cat for three years as they didn't look after her, and her five kittens, to a cat shelter for rehoming as I had been evicted from my house and couldn't look after her or her kittens any longer. I wanted to find a solution where I could keep her, or keep her in my life by giving her to friends or acquaintances, and felt so many conflicting emotions. I felt, and still feel, such guilt, and I still feel a great deal of sadness and haven't recovered from the feeling of loss.",
          "September 2024 Poznań, I had to decide to put my beloved 20-year-old cat to sleep. My despair plus lack of family support",
          "It took place a few months ago. My cat swallowed some string and the vet bill to get it out was $16 000. She would have died if I didn't go through with it. I decided to pay the money and she is healthy and well today. I didn't have enough money and I had to borrow some from my parents."

I had consulted with my wife that if I could not fix this appliance we would have to dig into our savings and get a new one. I had for the past month tried my best to avoid this expensive outcome. The fridge was constantly at minus 7 degrees which froze everything making it a freezer. I tried removing the back panel to see if it frosted which there was very little. I cut the power to the fridge for 30 minutes in the hopes of resetting the temperature gauge but nothing worked. In the end we decided on the new fridge and made the costly decision to buy a new one.",

Living just outside of a big city, I have some transit options but not a lot, but needed to weigh the pros and cons of the cost of a new car with how much time I would save and money saved on Uber rides when transit wasn't feasible This was something that I knew had long term consequences since it would be an investment I'd be left with for the next 8+ years. It also involved a major financial cost, plus the time investment in either case (to get a car, or extra time if I didn't buy one)",

I thought back to another car I wanted that was similar price but a little cheaper. I had to decide if I wanted to purchase a car from them that day or go home and spend more time thinking about it. I felt rushed though because my mother took off work to be with me and I did not want to waste her day not buying myself a car like I said. Myself and my mother were involved. We were at the Mercedes-Benz dealership when it took place. Nothing was happening at the time except the seller and my mother waiting on me to come to a decision. I felt a little rushed by my mother. I could tell she was annoyed so that made the decision even more difficult for me because I felt like I did not have enough time to sit and really think about which car I wanted.

It was a difficult decision for me to buy a tablet because I didn’t have that much money. I felt that spending money on this non-necessity was a stretch for my financial resources at the time. But I also felt that I could use the tablet to do some learning work, which I could actually do on a computer, but I also wanted to study in bed, so I had a strong desire to buy it. In the end, I couldn’t resist the temptation and bought it. The main problem is to choose a tablet with high cost performance. How to choose, based on what parameters to choose, based on my budget, and whether it will be really useful after buying it. After searching on Xiaohongshu, I finally chose a suitable tablet with high cost performance. I can also pay in installments on Douyin. Anyway, it took me about a week to choose the right tablet.",

          "Buying a new phone turned out to be a difficult decision, but not because I am well versed in the technical characteristics of smartphones, but because, after making a purchase through the marketplace, I learn in the news about a new law on IMEI verification of phones. And so a simple purchase becomes nervous, the media publish the same custom-made article with the same text without specifics on how to verify a phone or what to do if the phone arrived after the date by which it was possible to verify the phone. At that time, my old phone was very unpleasant to use, it hung up in simple tasks, strange bugs occurred, and all this put emotional pressure on me every day holding the old phone in my hands I wanted to get rid of it. And now, after a month of waiting, a notification arrives that the order was canceled unilaterally. Leaving me without a new device and another 5 business days to wait until the money spent on its purchase is returned. But I was already in the mood for this device, so I start looking for other possible ways to purchase it. Which led me to TaoBao, making a direct purchase from China and another wait. And the time window for possible phone verification was getting smaller, later the law was postponed for 1 month, which allowed activating the phone without possible network blocking. 1. Waiting - nothing is more annoying than a long and languid wait for the result 2. The marketplace scam - OZON at that moment turned out to be an honest platform for me, which doesn't care, the order was canceled because we want it that way 3. With the fear that the phone will be stolen at the post office - although I'm still young, I have already encountered the negativity of Kazpost, SDEk and other companies, they lost my parcels, once someone even opened the parcel and stole electronics from it worth more than 120,000 tenge (as of 2018) 4. Incompleteness and inconvenience of the phone verification service - in order to carry out the service, it was necessary to register using only an electronic digital signature, although nowadays everyone uses QR codes, and also the fact that on the site, when verifying the OnePlus brand in the phone brand field, the site's prompts gave false information, it turns out that it was necessary to write \"1+\" and not \"Oneplus\".

Basically she had been promoted to a new position a few months ago, and her old position was going to be posted and opened to applicants. She had offered to give me a referral. So I guess the \"who was involved\" was basically me, my wife, and my wife's friend. 1) We would've had to move to a new city.   2) The best case scenario for moving would've been to get an offer by the end of May, give notice to leave our rental for end of August. All the rentals available over there of course are only looking for people right now for June or July start dates, so it was going to be difficult to be confident that we'd have a place locked down to move to.  3) I didn't want to commit to the process, go through interviews, and then turn them down later on. I wasn't sure if that would negatively impact the perceptions of my wife's friend at her company at all.   4) We were not really financially prepared to put up the first/last month's rent at a new place right now, which probably would've been $4000/5000  5) I know my wife must be unsatisfied with our current living conditions. She makes a lot more money than me right now as well.",

          "In April 2025, I decided to move my 20-year-old student son (son) who lives with me to a separate apartment. He has lived with me for 20 years. I made this decision consciously. Because I think the time for separation has come, and even exceeded it. He does nothing at home, does not clean the house, does not cook, and has become completely lazy. He hangs out with friends all night, and I can't sleep thinking about him. This is starting to get on my nerves. So I decided to let him try to live independently. 1. The cost of renting an apartment in Almaty is high, and we agreed that I would pay for the apartment until he graduated. 2. After we separated, I started worrying: whether he went to bed on time, ate, dressed cleanly, missed classes, and got into trouble for something.",
          "The decision to buy a flat and thus take out a 30-year loan. I made it less than half a year ago. For obvious reasons, it is a very serious decision, it involves a more permanent choice of place of residence, taking on financial burdens, etc. An additional difficulty for me was that I made it at a time when I was taking important exams at the university and preparing to defend my doctorate, and I could not take any leave from work because I had used it earlier to write my doctoral thesis. My parents also participated in the decision-making process, who helped me a lot in financial terms. They also helped me look for a flat. The decision was also influenced by a friend from whom I had previously rented a room, who assured me that although he was planning a general renovation, it would not take place immediately, so I could still be calm about the possibility of continuing to rent the room for some time (although it was known that the renovation would eventually be carried out). The problem was certainly finding the time to make it in a fully thoughtful and unhurried manner. I had numerous concerns related to the fact that I would not check the apartment thoroughly enough or that the formalities related to taking out a loan would be time-consuming and would negatively affect my doctorate, cause me to do badly on exams or defense or fail the deadline. Fortunately, thanks to a good credit advisor and real estate agent, it went smoothly. Despite the fact that I did not try, for example, to talk to the neighbors before buying, it turned out that I had come to the right place.  Another problem was that I decided to live in a city other than the one where my university is located, which made it difficult to start scientific work in the future. So I had to decide whether I wanted to work at the university before I even found out how my doctorate would be received and whether it would open the door to professional scientific work. However, I decided that the city where my university is located is even more expensive and far from my hometown, and working in science is associated with low wages, so I have to choose a safer and more reliable life option - working outside of science.",

However, in order for our children to receive a better education in a big city and for us to have more opportunities for our own career development, we felt that it was necessary to buy a house in a big city. The family sat together and discussed repeatedly, each with their own concerns, and the atmosphere was very solemn. The specific problems encountered when making this decision are: First, emotional separation. I have lived in my hometown house for many years and have deep feelings for it. I feel reluctant to sell it. Second, economic pressure. House prices in big cities are high. Even if I sell my hometown house, I may still have to bear a high mortgage loan, which will increase my living burden. Third, the problem of parents' adaptation. I am worried that my parents will have difficulty adapting to the new environment in the big city and lose their familiar social circle, which will affect their quality of life.",

Issues I encountered were mainly trying to find a house suitable for our large growing family that suited our needs but also offered much more than we would have got where we were residing at the time, to make it worthwhile relocating such a distance away. The other issue was around schools. We were having a lot of difficulty finding schools in the area of houses that were suitable, and also the school system changes in a certain area of the country, and it completely different to the school system of the rest of the country to trying to also manage that was difficult. it was also an emotional toll on our children, as we would be removing them from their friends.",

My husband and I both worked long hours in stress jobs. Our lives were chaotic and out of control. We discussed my quitting my job which was so difficult. I had been there for 24 years, had a pension, benefits, extremely good salary etc. We would lose all of this as my husband was self-employed. We would also be down to one income which wasn't easy at all. I spoke to three friends who I trusted. Two said 'do it' and one said 'you will never work again. You will lose out on changing technology and you'll be so far behind no one will hire you'. this last comment weighed on my mind greatly, as I had intended to reenter the workforce at some point again.   I had been working part-time jobs since I was 14 years old and full-time as of the age of 17 years old. I was very used to my own income and leading a fairly comfortable life style. I encountered resistance from my husband who didn't want to lose the salary, benefits and pension. I encountered resistance from one trusted friend. I encountered the most basic issue of continuing to live our lives on half the money and was worried about that. I did not feel confident in my decision but also knew that our lives couldn't continue the way they were. The daily stressors and pressure were taking their toll on both of us. I wasn't happy.",

However, because of a job promotion, I had to go to work in another city on July 1, 2017. When I heard the news of my grandma's death on the morning of July 14, I regretted my decision. Specific questions: 1. If I stayed and did not go out of town, I could accompany my grandma, but I might have missed the opportunity for promotion. 2.

The whole family was involved, who took care of my grandfather during his hospital stay. Ultimately, my grandfather died in the hospital and I only came for the funeral. The problem I encountered was the distance from my hometown which made it difficult for me to get there, as I didn't have the opportunity to come for a short while and would have had to stay there longer. The second problematic issue was that I didn't really see the point in coming because I would only add to the family's problems related to the need to organize my stay, and it would be better if they took care of my grandfather. Plus, my coming wouldn't help at all, and my relationship with my grandfather was never very strong.",
          "This decision was about whether I should go back to my hometown to see my grandma off for the last time. At that time, I was participating in a particularly important project. The success of the project was related to my future development and promotion. It was at a critical stage and I was very busy and tired every day. Just when the project was at a critical stage, I was out of town and my parents informed me that my grandma had passed away due to illness. I was very sad and wanted to ask for leave from my leader to go home to attend the funeral. But the leader suggested to me from another perspective that if I asked for leave to go home now, I would inevitably be unable to complete the project I was participating in, and I would not be able to get another opportunity for a long time in the future, and my professional efforts would be wasted. I was asked to make a decision after weighing the pros and cons. I finally chose not to go home to attend my grandma's funeral. First of all, there is the struggle and pain in my heart about family affection and my own development. On one hand, there is my grandmother who loves me and this is my last chance to see her in my life. On the other hand, there is my future career. No matter which aspect, it is extremely important to me. No matter what choice I make, I will be extremely tormented and painful. Secondly, there are the comments of relatives and friends around me. If I don’t go home to attend my grandmother’s funeral, relatives and friends around me will inevitably point out and evaluate my behavior and my parents, which will make us suffer moral torture. Thirdly, there is the guilt for my parents. My decision and behavior will bring more criticism to them who are already sad, and make them \"shame\" in the family. Finally, there is the guilt of my direct leader. My leader treats me very well and is dedicated to promoting me. My performance and results will also be related to the evaluation and status of the leader. I feel ashamed of his teachings and cultivation of me in the past few years.",

However, the situation at home became untenable and there was no alternative but to arrange nursing home care. A sense of not being in control- as now the nursing home staff were responsible for him. A sense of loss- as we were no longer together as we once had been.

          "Deciding whether or not to visit my ill father in the hospital was the most difficult decision that I've had to make within the last 6 months. In January 2025, my father's health deteriorated at an alarming rate. It specifically involved his ability to remember things and this became very dangerous very quickly. My brother took him to the hospital early January to see what was wrong. They ran a number of tests and although he isn't officially diagnosed, the doctors and specialists suspect that he has dementia.   He was at that hospital for about a month and a half, and in between that time, they did bring him back home because my mom wanted to see if she could provide at-home care. He didn't lose his ability to walk, move around or eat so I think she wanted to take care of him from home.   After 3 days of him being essentially unmedicated, he quickly spiralled into paranoia and erratic behaviours like assuming that the neighbours were conspiring to hurt him. We took him back to the hospital and he stayed there until they figured out how much medication he needed to function without paranoid thoughts or aggressive behaviours. When my dad was first taken to the hospital, he started to lose a lot of weight. He didn't like the hospital food and my mom's homemade food was his preference so he ate less and less. His weight loss coupled with his spotty memory concerned our entire family, especially his children. We all reacted to this differently, but the one thing we had in common was that we hadn't seen anyone in our immediate family die. We didn't know what it'd be like to lose an immediate family member, especially one as important as our father.  Deciding whether or not to visit my father in the hospital was a difficult decision to make because we didn't have the best relationship growing up. He was physically present and financially provided for me and my siblings to the best of his abilities, but he was emotionally absent. I didn't really know who he was as a person, and any attempts that I made as a child to talk to him and be near him were met with disapproval from him. He would end the conversation or sometimes even ignore me. It didn't take me long to realize he didn't want to talk to me, and he wasn't the type of father that would hug me or speak warmly to me.   I understand the finality of death but even with that understanding, I hesitated to visit him because I couldn't let go of all of those feelings of disappointment and a lack of connection to my father. I didn't want to visit him, and that realization shook me. In the end, I settled for a brief phone call while my mom was at his bedside.",

As we started to get up, my brother (the lawyer) was called to inform him that the husband of another sister—who is not close to me—had committed suicide. We quickly discussed what to do. We were on my farm—where there is no public transportation—and everyone depended on my car. So we decided to head to the capital to accompany the widowed sister through this ordeal. 1.

I failed repeatedly along the way, and gradually began to doubt whether I was not suitable for this path. My family advised me to persist, and I also made up my mind to prepare for the exam with all my heart. In addition to eating and sleeping, I read books and did exercises to review, and gradually improved. My scores also improved with each practice. However, when the national exam came that year, my grandfather died of illness. The day of his burial happened to be November 28, which was the annual national civil service exam. If I missed it, I would have to wait another year. At first, my family was worried about the impact on my mentality and my future, and they were reluctant to tell me the news of my grandfather's death. I accidentally learned about it from my childhood friend. After careful consideration, in such a dilemma, I decided to give up the exam. If I missed this time, I still have many more chances, and there is still a future. However, my grandfather is gone, and there is no future. I must go to see him off and see him, otherwise it will be my lifelong regret. When I made this decision, I struggled for a long time. After all, I had worked hard for two years, and I should have gained something from my hard work. But I would regret not going back. This decision was also opposed by my family. They thought that the dead were gone, and people would eventually leave. But young people still had to live, work, and look forward. They thought I should not go back.",

          "The most difficult decision I had to make was to go to an expensive university or a state university. My family was involved in the decision. It took place at home, and there was a lot of deliberating. There was always a pro and a con to this type of decision-making. Because this your life and you want to make the best decision for your future. The specific issue I had was I really wanted a university-type of experience. I wanted it to have a strong football program and awesome Greek life. The place I wanted to have all that and was a very prestigious place. The only problem was the cost of tutuion and boarding were so high that I would be laced with debt well into the future. State school's were at a lower cost but did not have the reputation of the university. It was a long thought out process and it wasn't an easy decision.",
          "This decision was about whether to continue taking the postgraduate entrance examination after failing. My parents and I participated in the discussion at that time. It was in early 2022, when I failed the second attempt at the postgraduate entrance examination. I had a face-to-face chat with my parents at home about whether I should continue taking the postgraduate entrance examination. At that time, I had just experienced the failure of the second attempt, and it was difficult to get over the sadness. After a period of sadness, my family decided to have a good chat about the next decision. The biggest difficulty was that after experiencing two failures, it was difficult for me to get over the sadness, and I was struggling with the choice of going to work or continuing my studies.",
          "When I graduated from college, I faced three choices: taking the civil service exam, taking the postgraduate entrance exam, and finding a job. Different choices meant different life directions, so I asked my teachers, friends, and parents at school about their opinions on this matter. With their help, I made the decision to take the postgraduate entrance exam. 1. Is it worth the human and material resources required to take the civil service exam? 2. Do I want to continue my studies and learn more academic knowledge? 3. Does my family support my choice?",
          "It was a decision about the course of study I am starting this year. My parents were involved, as were friends and family. The decision dragged on for many weeks, but after a long and exhaustive research I managed to choose. The decision was made a week ago. Choice paralysis - too many directions that interest me, directions where my friends go, earnings, travel time, diplomas",
          "This decision concerned starting my second cycle of studies in the same field, but with a different specialization. I thought about this decision for a long time, involving myself, my loved ones, and my friends. It happened two years ago, when I was finishing my part-time bachelor's degree, but I couldn't afford a uniform master's degree at another university. I didn't know whether to check off these studies on principle or drop them and focus on my professional career. Finally, I took up and completed my master's degree. This decision was difficult because I didn't really know what I wanted to do professionally in life. In addition, my private life was very chaotic, unorganized and complicated at the time, so I preferred to bet on a safe solution, to give myself time. At that time, I didn't have the certainty that what I was doing was right. I probably still don't have it today.",

          "In the past six months, the most difficult decision I made was choosing a school for postgraduate study. It involved me and my parents. In March this year, I was at home preparing for the postgraduate study, struggling to decide whether to choose a prestigious school or a safe school. My parents wanted me to choose a safe one, but I wanted to give it a try. We had to discuss a lot every day, check information and compare, and it was difficult to make a decision. When making a decision, on the one hand, I was afraid that I would not be admitted to a prestigious school and would waste a year; on the other hand, I was unwilling to choose a local school because I felt that it would not be a challenge. On the other hand, my parents and I always disagreed, and we always quarreled when communicating, making it difficult to balance our ideas.",

At that time, I actually wanted to choose a less popular major. I wanted to study Korean, a minor language, but my parents wanted me to apply for a major that would be helpful for the civil service exam, such as Chinese language and literature. First, I had to choose between the major I wanted to study and the popular majors. Then there were the expectations of my parents and the future career planning. Secondly, whether the major I was interested in could help me in my career in the future. Finally, there was the pressure from my parents.",
          "Which university should I study at? Because my family wanted an eastern university, but I preferred a western one. This really bothered me. Finally, I listened to my family. I AM VERY CLOSE TO MY FAMILY AND MY FATHER ALWAYS CALLS AND ASKS ABOUT ME. THIS MAKES ME DISTURBING",

This took place over a few weeks during the last few months of my senior year. I had frequent arguments with my parents. It was a stressful decision since I wanted to listen to my parents since they were paying part of my tuition, but I also wanted to listen to my gut and choose the school I wanted.",
          "The decision was about which university I should attend after high school. I had been accepted to two main choices. I had been recruited by the coach of my main sport to attend one of them. The university I was recruited to attend was out of town. The other choice was in my city, not far from where I lived, so I could continue living with my parents if I went for this one. I could pursue my sport at either, but the out of town one was stronger in terms of my sport. Academically, the home town one seemed a bit superior. I was somewhat torn, but in the end I decided to stay in my city.",

          "I had to decide whether to quit university and move to online university. It was just me involved it was in September 2022, and I had just been through a very traumatic event and wasn't managing to go into uni or do any work so I was considering moving to the open university. It was hard to know what was the right thing to do and I didn't know if things would get better and I would improve mentally.",
          "It was about an academic decision. The people who were involved at the time were me and my friends. They helped me a lot in the process. I was at my university and at home because it was something that took about 3-5 months to process. It happened at the end of last year between September and January. I was going through a bit of a difficult period in my academic life. I needed to decide which subject to focus on in a discipline that was extremely important in the course. I was unsure about which subject to address and whether it would be the most correct one.",

          "The most difficult decision I've had to make in the past six months was whether or not to keep going to college. It was a decision that mostly relied on me, although my mom did give some input, which was helpful. This would have been a few months ago, though I don't recall exactly when it was, and I was at home. It was around the same time that we began worrying about the election, if I recall correctly. My main issue was the fact that I don't have the money to continue, but I'd already spent so much of it on my school. It felt like a waste not to go back.",
          "So far the decision was to choose a university degree, my mother, my father and I. I was finishing high school. the city, the value of the university",
          "The decision was about choosing where to go to college; on the evening of June 28, 2009, in the study room of my hometown, my parents and I made the difficult decision of choosing a college. On one side is a 985 university in Beijing that I like, majoring in astronomy, and on the other side is a local 211 university that specializes in computer science. The employment opportunities for ideal majors are limited, which conflicts with the stability in the eyes of the elders; going to Beijing is expensive;",
          "The most difficult decision I had to make in the last 6 month is picking what university I had to go to. I had very lengthy discussions with my parents surrounding that topic. It was a conversation that took place across many weeks before the due date. Discussions such as the tuition, places to live, etc were topics that were discussed multiple times. I had issues such as money for tuition, places to live, and the commute.",

          "I work for a flexible working hours company that assigns me to work with professors in different hospitals. I decided to resign when I was about to complete my 2nd year at the company I work for. The reason for this decision was that I was constantly exposed to mobbing and long working hours at the center I was authorized to. (08:00-23:00). My company ignored this situation. My salary was the same as my colleagues who worked 4 hours a day at other centers. I could no longer stand the intensity and pressure at the place I worked and I was physically exhausting myself. I did not want to leave because I did not want to burn my severance pay and I did not want to change companies because I was getting married in a year. Having a bad exit would not be good for my CV either because companies are in constant communication with each other. I could not stand it anymore and sent my resignation letter to my company. I thought I would leave badly, but my company finally said they wanted to meet and organized a secret inspection of the center I worked at without my knowledge. Seeing the difficulties I had experienced and expressed for so long, my company did not accept my resignation, apologized to me and changed my center. Now I am working really flexible hours and a better salary. The difficulty was in my own mind because I was aware that I would resign like everyone else before me because of my company's lack of response and that I would no longer be able to continue in this sector in this respect. If it weren't for the audit idea of one person from my company, I would be looking for a new sector by now.

Unfortunately, there had been complaints from some of our practitioners of having to do work that the administrative staff has to do. This individual who I will call Jasmine, was apparently always on her phone, combative, and would sometimes leave early and lie on her timesheet. This is also against our policy because client notes need to be securely locked away before leaving which is not possible if she is leaving before the practitioners hand them in. Even after discussing this with her, her changed behaviour was short-lived and she quickly fell into old habits. It was now on me to decide whether to let her go. This was a particularly difficult decision to make even though I've let people go before because Jasmine had confided in me of a stressful home life. I knew this would create a financial hardship and stress for her. I was conflicted between compassion and the duties of my role and to my workplace. She was also passed her probation, which meant we needed to provide detailed grounds for dismissal. We did ultimately let her go.",

          "I had just gotten married and had just shifted to Bombay for what I thought was a promising job opportunity. A culture and a definite financial shock for me. It was all nice to begin with, but slowly I started seeing patterns of bad behavior. My boss was not a very nice person, a worse manager. I had a few colleagues who had spoken out against him, but nothing really happened, instead they lost their jobs. 2 more colleagues, seemed to have completely given up and had become stubborn and supportive of his behavior. Silently bearing whatever anger, wrath and mood swings that were swung upon them and they went on to normalise this behavior within the office, cultivating a very toxic culture. In very cunning and smart ways, my boss delayed my probation. On grounds which were not very justified because my performance was much better and we were hitting all our milestones. But I figured that it was probably my fault yet I somehow managed to stay positive throughout this time. One fine day, my boss starts yelling at me for no reason whatsoever. I had been working very hard on a technicality and getting it sorted and had, indeed figured it out after some significant struggle and interactions with various departments. I lose it. This was uncalled for and probably the first time he lost his temper so bad on me. I asked him, politely to talk politely, yet he did not curb his tone or behavior. All this while my coworkers and subordinates heard all of it. I had seen them getting yelled at, getting ridiculed and getting threatened over and over again, and that's when it struck that if I don't curb this right away, I also will be subject to more frequent loss of temper and that is not what I have signed up for. I decided to speak against the boss and took matters to the HR and the boss' boss. That week felt like it lasted a month. I was tensed, anxious and just so angry. My entire point of moving to Bombay was about to get nullified, because I knew I could not continue to work with him - all the money put in to shift, a newly wed's house being set up, a new city to get adjusted to - all without any job security - is a bad combination. Irrespective, I chose to speak out and defend myself, and hoped that this behavior does not repeat itself with my coworkers. Uncertainty, Insecurity, Anxiety and Ambiguity. I felt like I had no support suddenly and that all my efforts will go down the drain just because some person is not nice to begin with. And I had no part in making him be like that so all that misplaced wrath is getting directed towards me and I can't help it at all. I also got to realise that once I did speak out, there will be no guarantee that anything will happen to the boss whereas my grounds will still be shaky because I am still on probation and the policies are set in a way which don't really help people in my condition. I could have gone in a financial crisis and would've lost my job if the resolution was not fair enough. But most of all, inspite of this - I was headstrong in going ahead with this complaint because I was very disturbed and messed in my head because of this incident and a series of shitty behavior.",

She criticizes me for inappropriate things, and has a personality disorder. I had to resign from my company where I had been working for 3 years in order not to suffer from this woman's whims.

At the hospital, they found that both lungs were full of secretions. After a difficult decision, I signed a document authorizing the doctors to no longer perform the intubation procedure if he got worse. Due to his weakness and pneumonia, he died. The hardest part was accepting my father's condition and having to sign a document authorizing the doctors not to continue with invasive treatment. Even though he was in a very bad state, it was difficult to make the decision not to leave him intubated. I know it would prolong his life for a few days, but he would suffer a lot.",

In the hospital, the doctor asked the family to decide whether to put the elderly on a ventilator. If she didn't use a ventilator, she would receive conservative drug treatment. If she was on a ventilator, she would suffer external trauma. The main problem is: should we use physical trauma to temporarily prolong life, or should we let the elderly suffer less trauma?",

          "One of the most difficult decisions was to go against my husband and the wishes of his entire family and not get my son admitted to a quack hospital for dengue recovery. We were visiting my mother-in-law's house in Nasik after the first wave of COVID-19 in India seemed to taper down. Both my husband and my son contracted dengue. There was a major panic as there was a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. The nearby hospitals in Nasik were shady and not following basic Covid protocols, so even though my husband chose to get admitted in Nasik, I decided, fought and got my 9-year-old son back to our home in Mumbai. My husband's mother, three sisters and their husbands, his cousins, all were upset and told me I was putting my son's life at stake and did not support me. I was literally shivering when I hired the cab to take my son, who had a 104-degree Celsius fever. I got him back home, consulted his paediatrician, and nursed him single-handedly while managing my WFH. My little child cooperated by willingly having 2 L of fluids orally everyday to wash out his infection. Those nights were the most terrifying for me when I used to sit awake, sponging him so that he would not get delirious with his high fever. He completely recovered at home within a week without any relapse, while my husband had to be admitted in Nasik for 20 days due to complications because of medical staff negligence. This decision was one of the most difficult ones as it involved the life of my son. Resistance from family. Lack of paediatric doctors and hospitals in Nasik. Wrong medical advice. The tests can be done only after 72 hours, so the Nasik doctor, assuming it was a COVID-19 infection, had prescribed a high dose of antibiotics, which caused severe diarrhoea because it was Dengue, and there are no medications to manage dengue; one can use only fever relief like Calpol and consume lots of fluid. Once tested positive, the medical advised to get him hospitalised and administer IV fluids in a overcrowded general ward.",

Me my sibling and mom were faced with a difficult decision of giving consent to the doctors in the hospital to place a tracheostomy in my fathers throat because they said that the ventilator could cause bacteria in his lungs. I knew my father would never want the tracheostomy but the doctors had gave me false hope that my father had a chance of surviving. For this reason we gave consent for this.

After being put on the ventilator, my dad passed 3 days later. Feelings of guilt. Fear. If things went wrong would I be blamed my family and friends for not just letting him remain as is.

She was detected with breast cancer in 2014. She was operated for the same and after that she recovered. A year back she was again diagnosed with breast cancer.

His lungs were bad, while unconscious his kidneys failed, he went into congestive heart failure and his gall bladder was destroyed. He had multi organ failure. No matter what they tried something else bad happened. It was hopeless. I had to give the ok to unhook him, once unhooked he stayed unconscious and died 18 minutes later. Doubt was the issue. I doubted myself, i doubted the decision. I kept thinking maybe something else would work. Maybe i was making the wrong choice. Even though all the doctors kept saying they were out of options to try, i still would not listen. Crazier things have happened.",

Outside the emergency room of the hospital, the doctor told us that we must decide immediately whether to rescue her. If rescue is possible, there is a possibility of saving her, but there is also a possibility of leaving sequelae. My mother was weak and could not withstand the rescue.
